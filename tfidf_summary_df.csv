2,"The emergence of online education platforms, driven by interactive mobile technology, has significantly reshaped traditional educational paradigms and underscored the critical need for advanced analysis and improvement of student interactions. Effective analysis of student interaction is crucial for enhancing teaching quality and optimizing the learning experience in these digitally enriched environments. Traditional analysis frameworks often face challenges such as inaccuracies in anomaly detection and inefficiencies in data handling, particularly when handling extensive datasets typical of online platforms. This study introduces a novel approach to enhancing student interaction analysis systems by leveraging the synergy between machine learning and advanced interactive mobile technologies. Initially, the study proposes an advanced anomaly detection method tailored for identifying irregu-lar student interactions. This method utilizes a blend of machine learning algorithms and the real-time data processing capabilities of mobile technology. Furthermore, to address the complexities of data transmission in mobile-based online education ecosystems, a state-of-the-art congestion control algorithm has been developed. This algorithm optimizes data flow, significantly enhancing transmission stability and efficiency. The integration of interactive mobile technology with machine learning offers a robust and dynamic framework for analyzing student interactions, thereby facilitating a more engaging and effective online educational experience. This research contributes to the advancement of online education quality and efficiency by emphasizing the role of interactive mobile technology in shaping future learning environments.

4,"With the incursion of data science into the academic field and the massification of social networks, it is possible to extract information on student satisfaction that contributes to feedback on teacher teaching strategies and methods. This article aims to determine student satisfaction with teaching performance, through sentiment analysis. Methodologically, the research is of a non-experimental longitudinal design, with a quantitative approach. Data collection was carried out through the social network Twitter, and data analysis was carried out through the sentiment analysis technique. As a result, it was identified that in the first week of class, the highest level of satisfaction was obtained, reaching 96.3% of the total number of students. Meanwhile, in the evaluation weeks, the highest level of dissatisfaction was reaching 29.17%. It is concluded that when going from totally virtual learning to hybrid learning, students express a certain level of dissatisfaction typical of a process of progressive adaptation. Therefore, teachers should take advantage of these findings to redesign assessment rubrics in the context of hybrid teaching. Aspects such as collecting opinions through social networks and extracting a degree of satisfaction through them apply in a crossed way to other professional fields.

6,"Student evaluations are an important aspect of business pedagogy. Social media-based evaluations, such as RateMyProfessors.com, empower students to evaluate faculty anonymously. A perusal of the literature indicates little to no prior research conducted on faculty perceptions of student usage of online evaluations. We posit that business students embody unique characteristics that influence their usage. We examine whether business students use RateMyProfessors.com in an ethical manner (i.e., honestly and without grade-related bias) and moderately (i.e., not only to rant or rave), whether gender differences exist in evaluations, and how confident students are in their evaluative abilities. We also posit that business faculty will understand how their students use online faculty evaluations. We summarize and discuss the empirical analysis of the hypotheses.

7,"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid shift to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT). Social networks had a key role in supporting the educational community in facing challenges and opportunities. A quantitative study was conducted to assess the Greek teachersâ€™ perceptions of social network support. Findings indicated that teachers turned to universities, educational institutions, the Ministry of Education, school support groups, and virtual communities for support. Additionally, the study revealed the barriers faced by teachers, including infrastructure limitations, technical difficulties, skill deficiencies, problems with studentsâ€™ engagement, and school policies. Teachersâ€™ evaluation of support regarding ERT provided fruitful insight. The results illustrate teachersâ€™ perspectives on ERT, contributing to the ongoing discourse on educational resilience to unpredictable disruptions. In conclusion, the role of social networks was considered as critical for the teachers to overcome barriers during ERT with the formation of social communities for support and the sharing of common experiences. Expertise in internet use and social networking played a significant role in readiness for the abrupt shift to distance education. The present study uniquely contributes to the educational field by emphasizing the role of teachersâ€™ support as an innovative approach to holistically enhance teachersâ€™ performance in ERT.

9,"Purpose: This study explored the effectiveness of a Problem-based Learning (PBL) teaching model on the WeChat public platform for radiation oncology residency training programs. Materials and methods: The WeChat PBL program was initiated in 2019. The study recruited student participants, on a voluntary basis, who were in their first and second years of standardized training in radiation oncology. We selected classic and trending issues in radiation oncology as the two main teaching topics. Students in the PBL group searched for relevant literature, summarizing PowerPoint presentations or academic speeches on specific issues published on the professional WeChat public platform after an in-depth review by teachers. The final national standardized training examination scores for resident physicians were used to evaluate teaching effectiveness. The graduation scores of the PBL and non-PBL groups were compared, and a stratified analysis was conducted based on the year of participation to assess the teaching effectiveness of this model. Moreover, questionnaires were administered to evaluate studentsâ€™ experiences. Results: Among the 36 students who joined the study in 2019, 16 (44.0%) voluntarily joined the PBL teaching group. Nine students started teaching PBL in their first year of residency, accounting for 47.4% of that year, and seven started in their second year, accounting for 41.2%. The average graduation scores of the PBL group were superior to those of the non-PBL-focused group for the same grade. The rate of high scores among students in the PBL group (56.3%) was higher than that of students in the non-PBL group (25%). Specifically, first-year residents who joined the PBL group had an average score of 92.3 Â± 2.2, significantly higher than their non-PBL counterparts, who scored an average of 88.6 Â± 4.6, showing a statistically significant advantage (p = 0.042). All students were satisfied with the PBL WeChat teaching and would recommend the PBL WeChat course to others. Conclusion: The PBL residency teaching model on the WeChat platform improved residency scores and garnered student satisfaction. Â© The Author(s) 2024.",Education
10,"In the education domain, the significance of student feedback and other stakeholders for raising educational standards has received more attention in recent years. As a result, numerous instruments and strategies for obtaining student input and assessing faculty performance, as well as other facets of education, have been developed. There are two main methods to collect feedback from students, as follows: the direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, feedback is collected by distributing a questionnaire and taking their responses. The limitation of this method is that the true experience of students is not revealed, and there is room for bias in the collection and assessment of such a questionnaire. To overcome this limitation, the indirect method can be followed where social media posts can be used to collect feedback from students as they are active on social media and use it to express their opinions as posts. To address the problem of the manual annotation of large volumes of data, this paper proposes a machine learning method that uses the sentiment 140 dataset as the training set to automate the process of annotations of tweets. The same method can be used to label any qualitative data. In total, 5000 tweets were scraped and considered for this study. Various pre-processing methods, including byte-order-mark removal, hashtag removal, stop word removal, and tokenization, were applied to the data. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) trigrams technique was then used to process the cleaned data. The TF-IDF technique using trigrams captures negation for sentiment analysis. The vectorized data are then processed using various machine learning algorithms to classify the polarity of tweets. Performance parameters such as the F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision are compared. With a 94.16% F1-score, 94% precision, 94% recall, and 95.16% accuracy, the Ridge Classifier performed better than the others. Â© 2023 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Education
13,"Nowadays, the development of online college education is in full swing, and various online college education platforms have also sprung up. The development of technology has made these online platforms more and more powerful, escorting the continuous development of online education. Colleges and universities, as the main front for the cultivation of high-quality talents in my country, have already introduced large-scale online courses into education and teaching, enriching the teaching content, and expanding the teaching form. In the face of new technical means and abundant online education resources, the teaching quality of online classrooms in colleges and universities is so low, which deserves our further reflection. For a long time, the effect of online classroom teaching in colleges and universities has been closely concerned by the academic community, but most of them start from external factors, ignoring the internal relationship of online classrooms. Clarifying the complex relationships in the online classroom field of colleges and universities and clarifying the rules of habitus and capital operation in the online classroom field of colleges and universities are the intrinsic motivation and important source to stimulate the vitality of the online classroom field of colleges and universities and improve the quality of teaching. By grasping the essence of classroom teaching and analyzing the inherent characteristics of the online classroom field, this research intends to clarify the proper state of the online classroom field, and to explore the reasons why the current online classroom field function has not been fully realized, so as to find the depth of college education.

20,"With the development of digital media technology, its application in teaching and learning is becoming more widespread. Digital media technology helps present information in transmitting knowledge or skills, reduces cognitive load, and promotes understanding of knowledge. Evaluation of the effectiveness of digital media teaching has also become important. A scientific and reasonable evaluation of digital media teaching effectiveness can help teachers select digital media technology and grasp the amount, degree, and timing of digital media use to change teaching effectiveness. This paper proposed using a combination of big data and artificial intelligence methods to evaluate the effectiveness of digital media teaching methods using the RBF neural network model. The digital media teaching effectiveness evaluation was used as the input variable of RBF, the degree of digital media effectiveness was the output variable and the neural network was trained through the collected sample data. The research results showed that the RBF neural network model proposed in this paper has a strong generalization and extension ability in evaluating digital media teaching effectiveness, providing a new way to evaluate digital media teaching effectiveness.

22,"This study is based on the university studentsâ€™ opinions on the social network Twitter, to learn the teaching performance in the context of virtual learning using sentiment analysis technique. However, to establishing the classification algorithm, an imbalance was evidenced in the amounts of opinions that qualify the teaching performance with the satisfied and dissatisfied class. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to determine the improvement in the performance of the student satisfaction classification algorithm, based on the class balancing method from the application of the minority synthetic oversampling technique (SMOTE). From the methodological point of view, the research is a non-experimental design, applied type, and quantitative approach. The data was collected through the social network Twitter for fifteen weeks to a population defined by mechanical and electrical engineering students. After the application of the SMOTE data balancing technique, it was identified that the algorithm which presents the best performance is Logistic Regression. It was possible to identify that the impact of improvement of the algorithm turned out to be an average of 2.17% in the accuracy, 84.78% in precision, 42% in the Recall (Sensitivity) and 58.33% in the F1-score. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the algorithm classifies with high probability the opinions of the students. Â© 2023 by the authors.",Education
26,"Background: The emergence of digital technology in the field of psychological and educational measurement and assessment broadens the traditional concept of pencil and paper tests. New assessment models built on the proliferation of smartphones, social networks and software developments are opening up new horizons in the field. Method: This study is divided into four sections, each discussing the benefits and limitations of a specific type of technology-based assessment: ambulatory assessment, social networks, gamification and forced-choice testing. Results: The latest developments are clearly relevant in the field of psychological and educational measurement and assessment. Among other benefits, they bring greater ecological validity to the assessment process and eliminate the bias associated with retrospective assessment. Conclusions: Some of these new approaches point to a multidisciplinary scenario with a tradition which has yet to be created. Psychometrics must secure a place in this new world by contributing sound expertise in the measurement of psychological variables. The challenges and debates facing the field of psychology as it incorporates these new approaches are also discussed. Â© 2023, Colegio Oficial de Psicologos Asturias. All rights reserved.",Education
28,"As the impact of social media grows, understanding the mechanisms through which social media affects employee behaviour increases. Employing social capital theory, we investigate the mechanisms through which social media usage affects organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) of faculty in Kenyan private universities. OCB is an important aspect of universitiesâ€™ performance, given the high level of autonomy in universities. We develop a theoretical model that posits direct links to OCB of three social media usages (social, cognitive, and hedonic) which affect OCB. We also posit indirect links (using autonomy as a mediator) that affect facultyâ€™s intrinsic motivation for OCB. Using descriptive cross-sectional survey, a mediated model was tested on 388 faculty. Results revealed: 1) social media usage significantly impacts OCB, with social and cognitive having a positive relationship, and hedonic having a negative relationship with OCB; 2) social media usage tends to increase autonomy. Findings of this study contribute towards job performance improvement. Â© 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Social Media
31,"In Australia, the Teaching Performance Assessment (TPA) is a relatively new, mandatory hurdle which must be completed just prior to the graduation stage of initial teacher education (ITE) programmes. This high-stakes task is one of a growing number of requirements to come out of the standards and accountability regime as outlined in the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) document for accreditation for ITE programmes. We delve into the public commentary about the broader commission of preservice and graduate teacher quality in general and the TPA in particular. We draw on Bernsteinâ€™s pedagogic identities and deductively apply this theory to explore this phenomenon. We use a data set of publicly available legacy media and social media tweets made over a ten-month period from August 2019 to May 2020 to reveal the focus, inherent bias and pedagogic identities promoted by these public discourses. The paper concludes with discussion about the implications of these drivers on the public perception of quality in ITE and on the status of teaching more broadly. Â© Crown 2023.",Education
32,"With the deepening application of artificial intelligence in the field of education, teaching quality evaluation has become the key to improving educational effectiveness. In order to quantify the effectiveness of knowledge transmission and mastery in digital media teaching, this paper proposes an improved Bayesian knowledge tracking model (BF-BKT), which has been specifically optimized for teaching quality evaluation. The motivation stems from the shortcomings of existing technology in evaluating teaching quality, especially the lack of effective integration of student learning behavior and forgetting patterns. This article describes the development process of the BF-BKT model, which innovatively combines learning behavior data and forgetting patterns by introducing behavioral forgetting features to more accurately predict studentsâ€™ learning status and teaching effectiveness. The BF-BKT model not only considers whether students have mastered a certain knowledge point, but also further analyzes their forgetting situation at different time points, providing a more comprehensive perspective for evaluating teaching quality. To validate the performance of the BF-BKT model, we compared it with the traditional BKT model and two diverse BKT variants. We conducted systematic experiments and analysis by selecting public datasets as simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the BF-BKT model performs well in predicting studentsâ€™ knowledge mastery and evaluating teaching quality, and its performance is superior to other comparative methods, proving the effectiveness and superiority of the model.

36,"In the realm of education, understanding the impact of different teaching styles on student engagement and satisfaction is essential. Recent advancements in sentiment analysis provide new avenues for evaluating student feedback, particularly through informal channels such as social media. While formal student evaluations offer structured feedback on teaching styles, they may not fully capture the nuanced opinions and sentiments expressed by students in informal settings, such as social media. This research aims to address the gap by integrating sentiment analysis of social media data to evaluate teaching effectiveness across various styles and comparing it with formal evaluation results. This study employs sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to analyze student posts on social media platforms. The analysis includes the extraction of sentiment distributions, identification of common keywords, and tracking of sentiment trends over time. Additionally, formal student evaluations (Likert scale) are collected to offer a direct comparison. The teaching styles analyzed include lecture-based teaching, project-based learning, flipped classrooms, online learning, hybrid learning, and traditional exam-based learning. The findings demonstrate that student sentiment varies significantly across teaching styles. Flipped classrooms and project-based learning received the highest positive sentiment scores, while traditional exam-based teaching showed the most negative sentiment. Social media feedback tended to align with formal evaluations for certain teaching styles, such as the flipped classroom and hybrid learning but showed divergence in others, like online learning, which received higher sentiment in social media feedback. Trends over time reveal evolving sentiments, with fluctuating satisfaction as the academic semester progressed. The integration of social media sentiment analysis provides a more dynamic and real-time understanding of student experiences, offering deeper insights into teaching style effectiveness.

38,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to engage in the ubiquitous use of virtual interpreting teaching and learning. The sudden shift of teaching mode has resulted in unplanned challenges. The main concerns among teachers and students include teaching quality and learning effectiveness. To examine the effectiveness of interpreting teaching and learning online, we conducted a survey about students' perceptions of satisfaction concerning online interpreting teaching and learning via an online platform. This survey is composed of questions to measure student satisfaction from six aspects, namely, instructor, technology, setup, interaction, outcomes, and overall. Results showed that the shift to abrupt online interpreting teaching and learning did not have any significant impact on teaching quality and learning effectiveness. Findings also highlighted the need for further investigation of self-regulation and self-directiveness in online interpreting teaching and learning. Essential pedagogical tasks can be conducted online (e.g., triangulation exercises, relays, handover, and channel switching). Implications are provided based on the findings.

42,"Almost all educational institutions have shifted their academic activities to digital platforms due to the recent COVID-19 epidemic. Because of this, it is very important to assess how well teachers are performing with this new way of online teaching. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a new field that emerged from using data mining techniques to analyze educational data and making decision based on findings. EDM can be utilized to gain better understanding about students and their learning processes, assist teachers do their academic tasks, and make judgments about how to manage educational system. The primary objective of this study is to uncover the key factors that influence the quality of teaching in a virtual classroom environment. Data is gathered from the studentsâ€™ evaluation of teaching from computer science students of three online semesters at X University. In total, 27622 students participated in these survey. Weka, sentimental analysis, and word cloud generator are applied in the process of carrying out the research. The decision tree classifies the factors affecting the performance of the teachers, and we find that student-faculty relation is the most prominent factor for improving the teaching quality. The sentimental analysis reveals that around 78% of opinions are positive and â€œgoodâ€ is the most frequently used word in the opinions. If the education system is moved online in the future, this research will help figure out what needs to be changed to improve teachersâ€™ overall performance and the quality of their teaching.

47,"Objective: As an experimental biological science, physiology has been taught as an integralÂ component of medical curricula for a long time in China. The teaching effectiveness of physiology courses will directly affect students' learning of other medical disciplines. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current situation and changes in physiology teaching over 30 years in Chinese medical schools. Methods: National survey was conducted online on the platform SoJump via WeChat and the web. The head of the physiology department in medical school was asked to indicate the information of physiology education from three periods: 1991â€“2000, 2001â€“2010, and 2011â€“2020. The responses of 80 leaders of the Department of Physiology from mainland Chinese medical schools were included in the study for analysis. Results: The survey showed that the class hours, both of theory and practice, had been decreased. During the past 20 years, the total number of physiology teachers, the number of physiology teachers who had been educated in medical schools, and the number of technicians had been reduced, whereas teachers with doctorâ€™s degrees had been increased. In addition to traditional didactic teaching, new teaching approaches, including problem-based learning/case-based learning/team-based learning, integrated curriculum and formative evaluation systems, had been employed, mostly for more than 5 years, in some medical schools. Conclusion: The present study has provided historical data regarding the current status of physiology education in China and that in the past thirty years by showing that physiology education in China has developed quickly,even it faces many challenges.

60,"With the popularity of the Internet and the advancement of information technology, more and more people are accepting the teaching and sharing of knowledge through the digitalization of information. The widespread adoption of 5G technology has pushed online learning even further into the mainstream. However, because online teaching does not have the drawback of being intuitive like classroom teaching, teachers' assessments of students' learning situations are less accurate. As a result, how to effectively evaluate students' academic performance in the context of 5G wireless network technology is a pressing issue that must be investigated. By processing these heterogeneous large-scale learning records and integrating multiple perspectives to analyze this learning record information to identify students' learning behaviors, this study proposes an integrated analysis algorithm based on artificial intelligence information technology. The possible learning outcomes of students are predicted based on their current learning situation, so teachers can provide auxiliary teaching strategies to students who may have learning difficulties based on the predicted information. The method proposed in this article uses information technology to predict students' grades, and the analysis shows that the method is very effective. In this article, different grades of classification methods are used to analyze and predict the whole students. All grade classification methods are effective in describing decision rules. No matter what grades classification method is used, the error rate of students' grades distribution is predicted to be below 40%.  Â© 2022 Yushu Guan.",Education
63,"There is a growing view in conservation science that traditional ways to evaluate publications, researchers, and projects are too slow. This has led to a rise in the use of altmetrics, which are metrics based on social media data, news pieces, blogs, and more. Here we examine altmetric data linked to nearly 10,000 papers published in 23 conservation journals, exploring five issues that represent some of the challenges associated with using social media data in evaluating conservation. We discuss whether social media activity reflects meaningful engagement, and how easily individuals can manipulate scores by using bots or simply through active personal networks or institutional promotion services. Our analysis shows a highly skewed distribution of altmetric scores where most papers have such low scores that the scores likely convey little meaningful information. Examining scores that would be considered meritorious, we find that papers where the first author was male have higher scores than papers led by a woman, suggesting a gender bias in altmetric scores. Finally, this data set reveals regional differences that correspond with access to different social media platforms. Metrics, like altmetrics, may have a role to play when making rapid evaluations. However, such metrics should only be used after careful deliberation and should not be influenced by institutions looking for shortcuts, by companies looking to advance profits, or by individuals seeking to promote themselves, rather than generating meaningful engagement in scholarship and conservation action. Scholarly and conservation activities should be judged on the quality of their contributions, which will require the input of experts and direct contact with impacted communities.

64,"According to the European classification of skills, competencies, qualifications, and occupations (ESCO), transversal knowledge, skills, and competencies are pertinent to a wide array of occupations and sectors. Transversal knowledge, skills, and competencies are the foundational elements for developing the â€œhardâ€ skills and competencies necessary for success in the labor market. In this paper, we introduce an online platform for assessing the attainment of transversal and soft skills. This tool allows us to define levels of competency acquisition and measure studentsâ€™ development. The use of these competency levels helps improve the understanding of these skills and the evaluation process. The tool also enhances coordination among courses and teachers. The evaluation process can be established on three different levels: self-evaluation, peer evaluation, and teacher assessment. Developers, students, and teachers have assessed the tool has been developed following a lifecycle of evolutionary prototypes with successive refinements.

67,"Background: Prior research has documented the pervasive influence that peers can exert on adolescentsâ€™ lives. However, knowledge on whether adolescentsâ€™ perceptions of the quality of the teacher's instruction are also prone to peer influences is lacking. Method: This study (N = 248 German adolescents) used longitudinal social network analysis to investigate whether (a) friends become more similar in their teaching quality perceptions (influence effects) and/or whether (b) students with initially more similar perceptions of teaching quality were more likely to become friends (selection effects). We also explored whether (c) students with more positive teaching quality perceptions were better integrated socially. Results: We did not find support for influence or selection effects. However, students who rated their teacher's instruction more positively were better integrated socially. Conclusions: Our work adds to research on the role of peers in adolescence and enhances our understanding of peer influences on studentsâ€™ perceptions of instruction. Â© 2024",Education
69,"Hypothetically, a student could attend a class, listen to lectures, and pass the class without knowing or interacting with other students. What happens to the network when the classroom expectations change? For example, there is a coursework expectation that students exchange contact information, or the instructor uses collaborative learning practices. Or what if the principal investigator (PI) of a scientific team goes on a sabbatical? This study uses the framework of classrooms because of their relatability across science. We asked how do different instructor coursework expectations change network structures within a classroom or other learning environments? A social network survey was administered at the start and end of the semester (pre- and post-test) in six university sociology classrooms to explore how expectations impacted the communication and learning networks. We found practical changes in course expectations impact the communication and learning networks, suggesting that instructors, facilitators, and others could be the archintorTM (architect +instructor+facilitator) of the network. Understanding that expectations can impact a networkâ€™s structure marks a paradigm shift in educational assessment approaches. If the archintorTM has identified the â€œoptimalâ€ network structure, then their task is to design expectations that result in specific interactions that ultimately improve student achievement and success. This work provides recommendations for classroom archintorsTM to create the most impactful classroom networks. Future research should extend beyond education and classroom networks and identify the best or desired networks in other areas like public policy, urban planning, and more. If these â€œoptimalâ€ networks were identified, an archintorTM could design a social network to solve wicked problems, manage a crisis, and create social change. Â© 2023 Love et al.

82,"The development of human-computer interactive items in educational assessments provides opportunities to extract useful process information for problem-solving. However, the complex, intensive, and noisy nature of process data makes it challenging to model with the traditional psychometric methods. Social network methods have been appliedÂ to visualize and analyze process data. Nonetheless, research about statistical modeling of process information using social network methods is still limited. This article explored the application of the latent space model (LSM) for analyzing process data in educational assessment. The adjacent matrix of transitions between actions was created based on the weighted and directed network of action sequences and related auxiliary information. Then, the adjacent matrix was modeled with LSM to identify the lower-dimensional latent positions of actions. Three applications based on the results from LSM were introduced: action clustering, error analysis, and performance measurement. The simulation study showed that LSM can cluster actions from the same problem-solving strategy and measure studentsâ€™ performance by comparing their action sequences with the optimal strategy. Finally, we analyzed the empirical data from PISA 2012 as a real case scenario to illustrate how to use LSM. Â© 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",Education
83,"When using machine-learning techniques to determine algorithms or ranking models that identify student satisfaction, algorithms are often trained and tested on a single data set, leading to bias in their performance metrics. This article aims to identify the best algorithm to classify the satisfaction of university students applying the K-fold cross-validation technique, comparing the error rates of the performance metrics before and after its application. The method used began with the collection of student opinions on the teaching performance of the social network Twitter during an academic semester. Then, sentiment analysis was used for data processing, through which it was possible to categorize the opinions of the students into â€œsatisfiedâ€ or â€œdissatisfied.â€ The results showed that the algorithm with the lowest error rate in its performance metric was the support vector machine (SVM). In addition, it was identified that its classification probability reached an accuracy of 91.76%. It is concluded that SVM classification using K-fold cross-validation will contribute to determining which factors associated with the teacherâ€™s didactic strategies should be improved in each class session, since traditional surveying techniques have shortcomings.

84,"The use of social media such as Twitter has gained popularity in education during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study included 22 high-quality peer-reviewed journal articles for the meta-analysis. The authors reveal that there are no significant differences in teaching effectiveness between the Twitter and non-Twitter-assisted learning approaches. Twitter-assisted learning outcomes are significantly higher than the non-Twitter-assisted whether Twitter is used as a supplementary or an integrated tool. Twitter-assisted learning can lead to significantly higher learning outcomes than non-Twitter-assisted learning in the USA, Greece, and Sweden, but no significant difference is revealed in Spain. Swedish users hold significantly positive attitudes towards the use of Twitter in education, but no significant difference is found in the USA. Twitter-assisted learning can cause significantly more engagement than non-Twitter-assisted in the USA, and male learners have significantly higher learning outcomes than females in both the USA and Spain.

86,"In August 2020, the UK government and regulation body Ofqual replaced school examinations with automatically computed A Level grades in England and Wales. This algorithm factored in school attainment in each subject over the previous three years. Government officials initially stated that the algorithm was used to combat grade inflation. After public outcry, teacher assessment grades used instead. Views concerning who was to blame for this scandal were expressed on the social media website Twitter. While previous work used NLP-based opinion mining computational linguistic tools to analyse this discourse, shortcomings included accuracy issues, difficulties in interpretation and limited conclusions on who authors blamed. Thus, we chose to complement this research by analysing 18,239 tweets relating to the A Level algorithm using Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), underpinned by social actor representation. We examined how blame was attributed to different entities who were presented as social actors or having social agency. Through analysing transitivity in this discourse, we found the algorithm itself, the UK government and Ofqual were all implicated as potentially responsible as social actors through active agency, agency metaphor possession and instances of passive constructions. According to our results, students were found to have limited blame through the same analysis. We discuss how this builds upon existing research where the algorithm is implicated and how such a wide range of constructions obscure blame. Methodologically, we demonstrated that CL and CDA complement existing NLP-based computational linguistic tools in researching the 2020 A Level algorithm; however, there is further scope for how these approaches can be used in an iterative manner.

87,"This paper proposes a multidimensional social open model to evaluate the teaching strategies adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing the decisions made by teachers by a group of teachers acting as evaluators. Based on the analysis of previous studies on teaching, this study aims to propose a formal model for the evaluation of teaching strategies in four dimensions: sustainability, usability, accessibility, and creativity. The use of information technologies to measure teaching strategies can bring decisive advantages. This work has been inspired by social rating systems of social networks to propose a measurement system in which a potential large number of evaluators with different levels assess the strategies. In addition, the proposal also includes the evaluation of the evaluators' own work, assigning confidence levels that are based on their experience but also on their evaluations. In this way, we have a social measurement system, in the sense that participation is open to a large number of evaluators. A large community of teacher evaluators will increase the objectivity of the measurement. The outcome of the system will be a characterization of the teaching strategies that will allow to decide in the future which ones should be adopted according to the needs of each one.

The scale measured student faculty contact (SFC), cooperation among students (CAS), active learning (AL), prompt feedback (PF), time on task (TT), high expectations (HE), and diverse talents and ways of learning (DTWL). The research instrument also included three open-ended questions. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Human Development Index (HDI). The Online Teaching Effectiveness Index (OTEI) value was moderate at 0.62. Challenging aspects of online education were found to be access, learning experience, technology, resources, and infrastructure, the need for face-to-face interaction, and the health hazards of long screen time. The survey of 60 faculty members recorded online teaching to be sustainable, backed by institute support, flexible, and creates the possibility of peer learning. Lack of training resources, unsuitability of course design and practical courses for online mode, and the need for an overhaul of pedagogy were the challenges. Policymakers and digital companies should include infrastructural changes and investments at both the institutional and digital platforms level. Â© 2023 The Authors.

89,"Although it is true that artificial intelligence and data science have become key tools that contribute to the improvement of many processes, identifying patterns and contributing to decision making, however, there are environments in which they are not yet being using it relevantly and effectively. The objective of this study is to identify the relevant factors, based on the opinions expressed by the students through the social network Twitter regarding the perception of satisfaction with the teaching performance during the virtual learning environment. For which sentiment analysis and text mining are used under the Python programming language environment, through JupyterLab. As results, it was determined that a predominance of 57.27% of positive polarity, identifying that the relevant factors of student satisfaction with teaching performance, are related to the development of the teacher in the class sessions that contributes to the learning of the process control subject through the use of simulation tools such as simulink and tools linked to proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers; on the other hand, there is a percentage of negative polarity of 15.45% that belongs to the factors linked to the laboratory sessions in which graphic representation and block diagrams were used to explain the class session.

93,"Currently, the data generated in the university environment related to the perception of satisfaction is generated through surveys with categorical response questions defined on a Likert scale, with factors already defined to be evaluated, applied once per academic semester, which generates very biased information. This leads us to wonder why this survey is applied only once and why it only asks about some factors. The objective of the article is to demonstrate the feasibility of a proposal to determine the degree of perception of student satisfaction through the use of data science and natural language processing (NLP), supported by the social network twitter, as an element of data collection. As a result of the application of this proposal based on data science, it was possible to determine the level of student satisfaction, being 57.27%, through sentiment analysis using the Python library ""NLTK""; Thus, it was also possible to extract texts linked to the relevant factors of teaching performance to achieve student satisfaction, through the term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach, these being those linked to the use of tools of simulation in the virtual learning process.

104,"This paper focuses on the study of automated process discovery using the Inductive visual Miner (IvM) and Directly Follows visual Miner (DFvM) algorithms to produce a valid process model for educational process mining in order to understand and predict the learning behavior of students. These models were evaluated on the publicly available xAPI (Experience API or Experience Application Programming Interface) dataset, which is an education dataset intended for tracking studentsâ€™ classroom activities, participation in online communities, and performance. Experimental results with several performance measures show the effectiveness of the developed process models in helping experts to better understand studentsâ€™ learning behavioral patterns.

112,"The Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on various life settings. One of them is in educational institutions. The application of New Normal with its social distancing has made learning carried out remotely. The implementation of distance learning in schools needs an innovation through the use of Information and Communication Technology in learning. There are several Information and Communication Technology media that can be used in learning including computers and the internet. Teachers can design subject matter using computers. Then the material that has been designed is delivered to students via the internet network. Currently, there are many social media that support distance learning. SDIT Cahaya Hati has also conducted distance learning. Teachers need to prepare distance learning material in advance before it is delivered to students. This study aims to reveal the use of Information and Communication Technology by SDIT Cahaya Hati teachers in distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The type of this research is qualitative with interview data collection techniques, and documentation. The results show that the Cahaya Hati SDIT teachers have organized distance learning using Information and Communication Technology media. SDIT Cahaya Hati teachers use computers to make learning materials in the form of power points and learning videos. This material is delivered to students using the internet network through a WhatsApp group. Every day the teacher evaluates the learning and once a week the assignment is handed over to the teacher at school  Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Education
123,"As q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) theory can effectively express complex fuzzy information, this study explores its application to social network environments and proposes a social network group decision-making (SNGDM) method based on the q-ROFS. Firstly, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy value is used to represent the trust relationships between experts in the social network, and a trust q-rung orthopair fuzzy value is defined. Secondly, considering the decreasing and multipath of trust in the process of trust propagation, this study designs a trust propagation mechanism by using its multiplication operation in the q-ROFS environment and proposes a trust q-ROFS aggregation approach. Moreover, based on the trust scores and confidence levels of ex-perts, a new integration operator called q-rung orthopair fuzzy-induced ordered weighted average operator is proposed to fuse expertsâ€™ evaluation information. Additionally, considering the impact of consensus interaction on decision-making results, a consensus interaction model based on the q-ROF distance measure and trust relationship is proposed, including consistency measurement, identification of inconsistent expert decision-making opinions and a personalized adjustment mechanism. Finally, the SNGDM method is applied to solve the problem of evaluating online teaching quality. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Education
133,"With the advancement of information technology and the gradual advancement of ""internet+"", blended learning has become a hot topic in current higher education discussions and research. This paper analyzes the connotation of blended learning and the shortcomings of traditional teaching, it is believed that traditional classroom teaching mode and pure online teaching mode can no longer meet the needs of talents training in higher education institutions in the era of ""internet+"". Blended learning is the direction of teaching reform in colleges and universities, and it is an important practice trend of higher education informatization. The implementation of blended learning is not simply a combination of online teaching and classroom teaching, but a systematic project, which needs to be determined from the teaching objectives, teaching link design, online platform construction, classroom teaching guidance, teaching effect evaluation, etc. Starting from the pre-class knowledge learning, in-depth discussion in the class, after-class consolidation and expansion, curriculum assessment and evaluation, teaching effect reflection and other links, we truly achieve the result of ""teaching is methodical and learning is effective""to help students learn independently and efficiently to improve teaching effectiveness and students' practical innovation ability.

136,"In this study, we aim to deepen understanding of what it would take to develop the relationships, common understandings, and collective expertise that might support district-wide improvement efforts by examining the implementation of the Common Core and a teacher evaluation policy. Drawing on three years of social network data in three districts, we find that administrators were more likely to be talking together about teacher evaluation than the Common Core. Further, administrators with more positive views of the potential impact of these policies and their access to the human and technical resources necessary for implementation were more likely to engage in positive information seeking behaviors. These findings have important implications for policies intended to increase instructional coherence in schools and districts. Â© 2021, Arizona State University. All rights reserved.",Education
137,"This article analyses the impact of social media technologies on the work practices of university staff and attempts to uncover the dual anxieties they face. The research is based on investigation into WeChat groups comprising a sample of 90 university academic and administrative staff. I consider the reasons behind the additional workload of all staff, which is driven by the erosion of the boundaries between the public and private spheres on social media platforms. Participant observation of WeChat groups and interviews with academics and administrators reveal that the emphasis on collaboration on social media and chronic connectivity at work blurs the boundaries between work and private life. Underlying the increased workload and emotional engagement through WeChat groups is a faculty evaluation system that is shaped by market-driven key performance indicators (KPIs) and the centralization of university authority structures. The precarious work conditions that result has increased anxiety about work and private life in the academic community. However, the coercive working environment does not offer academic labourers much opportunity to resist. Â© The Author 2020",Education
