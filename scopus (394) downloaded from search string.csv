RG automatically provides a metric, the RG Score, to each RG account holder that serves as a measure of that SRA's ""academic""worth, productivity, and interaction with other SRAs. In 2017, this metric was described by RG as ""the RG Score takes all your research and turns it into a source of reputation,""indicating that ""it is calculated based on the research in your profile and how other researchers interact with your content.""However, the precise manner in which the RG Score is calculated was never made public because it is a proprietary algorithm, and requests to RG to disclose details of the equations used to calculate it were not met. Not unsurprisingly, RG announced that it would be phasing out the RG Score in June 2022. This article examines what is known in the literature about the RG Score, which may be perceived as a skewed metric because it may add excessive weighting to select aspects, such as questions and answers, rather than to the published literature of an SRA. The RG Interest Score is also critiqued. An author-based metric such as the RG Score that reflects a realistic balance between the most important academic factors while downplaying fairly redundant aspects such as the volume of answers might benefit SRAs. As for any metric, the RG Score should not be used in isolation, be gamed, or used as the basis of any financial remuneration schemes. © University of Toronto Press, 2023.","academic social network; accountability; altmetrics; metrics; proprietary algorithm; social web metrics; transparency","","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H04581, 21H03784)","Although this study and project was not funded, YY was funded by JSPS KAKENHI (20H04581 and 21H03784).

Effective analysis of student interaction is crucial for enhancing teaching quality and optimizing the learning experience in these digitally enriched environments. Traditional analysis frameworks often face challenges such as inaccuracies in anomaly detection and inefficiencies in data handling, particularly when handling extensive datasets typical of online platforms. This study introduces a novel approach to enhancing student interaction analysis systems by leveraging the synergy between machine learning and advanced interactive mobile technologies. Initially, the study proposes an advanced anomaly detection method tailored for identifying irregu-lar student interactions. This method utilizes a blend of machine learning algorithms and the real-time data processing capabilities of mobile technology. Furthermore, to address the complexities of data transmission in mobile-based online education ecosystems, a state-of-the-art congestion control algorithm has been developed. This algorithm optimizes data flow, significantly enhancing transmission stability and efficiency. The integration of interactive mobile technology with machine learning offers a robust and dynamic framework for analyzing student interactions, thereby facilitating a more engaging and effective online educational experience. This research contributes to the advancement of online education quality and efficiency by emphasizing the role of interactive mobile technology in shaping future learning environments. © 2024 by the authors of this article.","anomaly detection; congestion control; interactive mobile technology; machine learning integration; mobile data transmission optimization; online education platforms; student interaction analysis","Computer aided instruction; Data communication systems; Data transfer; E-learning; Efficiency; Engineering education; Integration; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quality control; Students; Telecommunication equipment; Anomaly detection; Congestion control; Data-transmission; Interaction analysis; Interactive mobile technology; Machine learning integration; Machine-learning; Mobile data; Mobile data transmission optimization; Mobile Technology; On-line education; Online education platform; Optimisations; Student interaction analyse; Student interactions; Anomaly detection","","","","","","","Singh A.

Academic portfolios document the multifaceted achievements of faculty members and help them in their professional progress and self-evaluation. This initiative adopted a systematic approach following the TU guidelines, incorporating lectures, mentoring, and collaborative sessions, and guiding educators to create portfolios that integrate teaching, research, and service activities. The project's use of digital tools enabled time efficiency, accessibility, and iterative improvement and improved the transparency and scope of faculty performance. The digital platform also facilitated real-time feedback and integration of the portfolio with a wider digital repository, which aligns with environmentally sustainable practices. Participant feedback highlighted increased motivation and a deeper understanding of the interaction between teaching and research. The project demonstrated that the digital portfolio powerfully aligned teachers' activities with their professional ethos and promoted continuous development and personal growth goals. This approach suggests the potential for transforming faculty development in the academic community. © 2024 The Authors.","Academic Portfolio; faculty development; SAP sheet","Academic portfolio; Collaborative sessions; Digital innovations; Faculty development; Faculty members; Research activities; SAP sheet; Self evaluation; Teaching activities; Teaching researches; Teaching","","","","","KOSEN; Kumoh National Institute of Technology, KIT; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (21H00914, 22K12284); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","JSPS Kakenhi (Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) supported this work with Grant Numbers 21H00914 and 22K12284.

This article aims to determine student satisfaction with teaching performance, through sentiment analysis. Methodologically, the research is of a non-experimental longitudinal design, with a quantitative approach. Data collection was carried out through the social network Twitter, and data analysis was carried out through the sentiment analysis technique. As a result, it was identified that in the first week of class, the highest level of satisfaction was obtained, reaching 96.3% of the total number of students. Meanwhile, in the evaluation weeks, the highest level of dissatisfaction was reaching 29.17%. It is concluded that when going from totally virtual learning to hybrid learning, students express a certain level of dissatisfaction typical of a process of progressive adaptation. Therefore, teachers should take advantage of these findings to redesign assessment rubrics in the context of hybrid teaching. Aspects such as collecting opinions through social networks and extracting a degree of satisfaction through them apply in a crossed way to other professional fields. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

There are ongoing concerns that this will negatively impact training and the attainment of competencies expected at consultant level. We undertook a UK-wide survey of gastroenterology trainees to establish their views. Method The British Society of Gastroenterology Trainees Section collected anonymised survey responses from trainees between June and September 2022 via an online platform. Results 40.3% of trainees responded. Strikingly, only 10% of respondents felt they could achieve certificate of completion of training (CCT) within a 4-year programme. Furthermore, 31% were not confident they would attain the required expertise in their subspecialist interest during training. 70.8% reported spending a quarter or more of their training in general internal medicine (GIM) and 71.6% felt this negatively impacted on their gastroenterology training. Only 21.6% of respondents plan to pursue a consultant post with GIM commitments. Regarding endoscopy, only 36.1% of ST7s had provisional and 22.2% full accreditation in colonoscopy. Although 92.3% of respondents wanted exposure to a 'bleed rota', this was the case for only 16.2%. Teaching quality was judged to be insufficient by 45.9% of respondents. Conclusion Respondents had struggled to achieve the necessary competencies for CCT even prior to the newly reduced 4-year curriculum. While still maintaining service provision, we must safeguard gastroenterology training from encroaching GIM commitments. This will be critical in order to provide capable consultants of the future and prevent UK standards from falling behind internationally.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

Social networks had a key role in supporting the educational community in facing challenges and opportunities. A quantitative study was conducted to assess the Greek teachers’ perceptions of social network support. Findings indicated that teachers turned to universities, educational institutions, the Ministry of Education, school support groups, and virtual communities for support. Additionally, the study revealed the barriers faced by teachers, including infrastructure limitations, technical difficulties, skill deficiencies, problems with students’ engagement, and school policies. Teachers’ evaluation of support regarding ERT provided fruitful insight. The results illustrate teachers’ perspectives on ERT, contributing to the ongoing discourse on educational resilience to unpredictable disruptions. In conclusion, the role of social networks was considered as critical for the teachers to overcome barriers during ERT with the formation of social communities for support and the sharing of common experiences. Expertise in internet use and social networking played a significant role in readiness for the abrupt shift to distance education. The present study uniquely contributes to the educational field by emphasizing the role of teachers’ support as an innovative approach to holistically enhance teachers’ performance in ERT. © 2024 by the authors.","emergency remote teaching; obstacles; pedagogy; social networks; sources of support; support","","","","","","Educational Institution of Government; Ministry of Education, MOE","The present study uniquely contributes to the educational field by emphasizing the role of teachers\u2019 support as an innovative approach to holistically enhance teachers\u2019 performance in ERT. The findings of our study indicated that teachers sought technological, psychological, pedagogical, and communication-related support. Additionally, the results confirmed recent findings concerning the obstacles faced by teachers, including infrastructure limitations, technical difficulties, skill deficiencies, problems with students\u2019 participation, and school policies. Inevitably, teachers reached out for support from universities, the Educational Institution of Government and educational institutions, the Ministry of Education, school support groups, and online virtual communities. In summary, teachers\u2019 evaluation of support, digital capabilities, satisfaction with students\u2019 participation, and the importance of ERT provided insight into their experience. In conclusion, these findings shed light on teachers\u2019 perspectives regarding ERT, contributing to the ongoing discourse about educational resilience in the face of unpredictable disruptions. This study is mainly focused on ERT, which is different than distance learning. Distance learning heavily relies on the learner\u2019s self-regulation. They find their ways of learning through structured and tailored learning environments designed with time flexibility and content adaptability. Despite this limitation, current research has the potential to lay the groundwork for further research and the development of strategies to enhance teacher preparedness and support. The necessity for programs offering technical support to teachers, as well as training in pedagogical teaching methodologies and increasing the effectiveness of teaching efficiency through mentorship was shown. The integration of preventive strategies, such as incorporating technology support into instructional coaching, as well as implementing a system for delivering assistance based on stakeholder requests, data, or feedback, would be a valuable development. In addition, forthcoming research should prioritize the provision of support and guidance for teachers to adapt to novel teaching environments and technologies like path tracking systems to collect data while a particular software or application is being used and to foster their continued professional development and welfare.

However, considering the high density of students and the potential for epidemic relapse, our medical morphological teaching team established a novel blended learning mode with mainly offline teaching in the general sections and blend learning in systematic sections. Specifically, this study sought to improve the teaching quality of the two courses of “Histology and Embryology” and “Pathology”, and lay a solid foundation for clinical medical undergraduates to learn medical courses well in the future. Methods: In the Spring 2021 semester, two classes from the Class of 2019 and two classes from the Class of 2020 were randomly selected as the intervention groups, to carry out blended learning of “Histology and Embryology”, and “Pathology”, respectively. Meanwhile, four parallel classes were randomly selected as control groups to carry out completely traditional offline teaching. The blended learning was based on outcome-based education concepts and used small private online courses from the “Xuexi Tong” (Century Superstar Information Technology Development Co., Ltd., Beijing) platform. In the theory class, case-based learning following a self-designed P-C-P-E-S-E (Pre-class-Case-Problem-Expansion-Summary-Expansion) teaching sequence was implemented. In the experimental class, a virtual digital platform with flipped classroom learning was integrated. Results: Both teaching satisfaction and students’ scores were found to be significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group. Furthermore, the intervention group also effectively surpassed the control group in terms of students’ comprehensive abilities such as drawing, scientific research, participating in competitions, forensic case analysis, and so on. Conclusion: Our novel blended learning approach strengthened the communication between teachers and students, obviously improved students’ self-directed learning abilities, and finally achieved the purpose of improving the comprehensive abilities of students. This mode is suited for the post-epidemic era and future variable environments. It also has substantial promotional instructive modeling value.

Materials and methods: The WeChat PBL program was initiated in 2019. The study recruited student participants, on a voluntary basis, who were in their first and second years of standardized training in radiation oncology. We selected classic and trending issues in radiation oncology as the two main teaching topics. Students in the PBL group searched for relevant literature, summarizing PowerPoint presentations or academic speeches on specific issues published on the professional WeChat public platform after an in-depth review by teachers. The final national standardized training examination scores for resident physicians were used to evaluate teaching effectiveness. The graduation scores of the PBL and non-PBL groups were compared, and a stratified analysis was conducted based on the year of participation to assess the teaching effectiveness of this model. Moreover, questionnaires were administered to evaluate students’ experiences. Results: Among the 36 students who joined the study in 2019, 16 (44.0%) voluntarily joined the PBL teaching group. Nine students started teaching PBL in their first year of residency, accounting for 47.4% of that year, and seven started in their second year, accounting for 41.2%. The average graduation scores of the PBL group were superior to those of the non-PBL-focused group for the same grade. The rate of high scores among students in the PBL group (56.3%) was higher than that of students in the non-PBL group (25%). Specifically, first-year residents who joined the PBL group had an average score of 92.3 ± 2.2, significantly higher than their non-PBL counterparts, who scored an average of 88.6 ± 4.6, showing a statistically significant advantage (p = 0.042). All students were satisfied with the PBL WeChat teaching and would recommend the PBL WeChat course to others. Conclusion: The PBL residency teaching model on the WeChat platform improved residency scores and garnered student satisfaction. © The Author(s) 2024.","Medical education; Problem-based learning; Radiation oncology;

The popularization of the WeChat platform has provided a broader application space for question banks, especially digital question banks. To improve the teaching quality of pediatric surgery, a digital question bank for pediatric surgery was constructed based on the WeChat platform and applied to the clinical teaching of pediatric surgery. We explore whether integrating the digital question bank into the WeChat platform can help improve examination scores and also explore students’ satisfaction. Methods: In this study, a clinical question bank covering pediatric surgery was established and then entered into the WeChat Official Accounts Platform. The instructor guides the medical students to use the WeChat platform for daily teaching activities and to complete the assessment of the digital question bank. A relevant evaluation system was established based on the big data results provided by the WeChat Official Account. This evaluation system was composed of the evaluation of instructors for the learning initiative and knowledge mastery of medical students and the evaluation of medical students for the teaching level of instructors and the digital question bank pattern. Results: A digital question bank of pediatric surgery was successfully established. A total of about 3,200 questions in the question bank were uploaded to the WeChat Official Account of the pediatric surgery department of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. Based on the digital question bank, partial clinical teaching tasks of pediatric surgery were completed, and the learning effects of medical students were evaluated. The question bank exhibited a favorable difficulty coefficient and discrimination, and the examination scores conformed to the normal distribution, indicating the higher scientific and effectiveness of this question bank. The questionnaire survey results demonstrated that most medical students maintained that the application of the new question bank based on the WeChat Official Accounts Platform can increase their learning interest in pediatrics, cultivate their clinical thinking, and enhance their clinical ability. Conclusion: A digital question bank of pediatric surgery was established for the first time based on the WeChat Official Accounts Platform. This digital question bank can be employed to evaluate the learning effects of medical students more scientifically, which contributes to improving teaching quality and teaching management. Overall, the new pediatric surgery question bank and the WeChat Official Accounts Platform can satisfy the development demands of pediatric surgery in the new era, exhibiting broad application prospects. © The Author(s) 2025.","Digital question bank; Pediatric surgery; Relevant evaluation system; WeChat Official Accounts Platform","Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Humans; Pediatrics; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; article; big data; clinical education; education; human; knowledge; learning; medical education; medical student; normal distribution; pediatric surgery; questionnaire; social media; teaching; medical student; pediatrics; procedures","","","","","Shandong University, SDU","Supported by Grant 2023Y030 from Research project on education and teaching reform of Shandong University.

Since 2000, the number of participating countries in these assessments has increased dramatically, revealing the dominance of a few education systems while exposing the deficiencies of many others. Especially for the latter group the question, as to why they participate in ILSAs, is puzzling. Existing literature attributes this participation to domestic factors or the influence of International Organizations. However, we argue that the global spread of ILSAs can also be explained by direct country-to-country dependencies through development aid. Methods: This study takes an interdependency-inspired approach, focusing on how bilateral development aid networks influence ILSA participation. Using advanced network diffusion and hurdle models, we analyse data from a global set of countries over the period from 1990 to 2012. The models examine the role of development aid distribution in shaping ILSA participation, with particular attention to how participation in ILSAs affects the likelihood of attracting additional donors and aid. Results: Our analysis reveals that the distribution of development aid has a significant impact on countries’ decisions to participate in ILSAs. Furthermore, we find that countries already involved in ILSAs are more likely to attract additional donors and aid within established donor-recipient dyads. These results demonstrate a clear connection between development aid distribution and the global spread of ILSAs. Discussion: This study highlights the role of monetary incentives, facilitated by the distribution of development aid, in promoting participation in ILSAs. Our findings suggest that the rapid spread of ILSAs is not solely driven by domestic factors or international organizations but also by the interdependent relationships formed through aid distribution networks. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of the factors driving global educational assessments and provide implications for policy-making in education and development aid.

This research aims to explore students’ perspective of Edulastic as the e-assessment tool, and the obstacles they experience while using this platform during school final summative assessment. The data were gathered using semi-structured interviews with six 12th graders of a private school in the town of Purwokerto, Indonesia. The data were processed qualitatively using thematic analysis. The results show that the participants had positive thoughts of Edulastic. It assists them by doing English assessments comfortably attributable to its flexibility and practicality. It also supports a system that prevents cheating among the students. However, they faced challenges with it due to inadequate equipment, including the device’s battery life issue, insufficient memory capacity and poor internet connectivity. To sum up, besides having a positive perception of the e-assessment, the students also experienced unavoidable problems before and while working on the e-assessment. The result of the study suggests Edulastic platform is a smart choice for educational institutions implementing online summative assessment despite technology infrastructure support constraints. © 2024 Kasetsart University.","Edulastic; EFL students; online assessment; school final summative assessment; views","","","","","","","","Adeoye-Olatunde O.

The research utilized a quantitative approach, surveying a sample of Chinese Medical Education teachers (N = 500) consisted of 342 males and 158 females with an age range between 30 and 65 (M = 43.69; SD = 9.31). The average tenure in the education landscape was 12.39 years (SD = 10.91) through an online platform. The primary aim was to explore how readiness attitudes influence the well-being and work capacity of Teachers in high-stress medical teaching environments. The survey incorporated self-assessment instruments to measure job stress, Readiness to Change attitudes, levels of flourishing, and personality traits (Extraversion and Neuroticism). Statistical analyses, including mediation models, were employed to test the relationships between these variables. Preliminary findings suggest a significant mediating role of Readiness to Change into the effects of job stress on flourishing and a moderation of extraversion into this relationship. The findings also failed to support the moderation of Neuroticism into the relationships, while the Higher order moderation showed a statistical marginal value. This indicates that effective readiness attitudes may not only mitigate the negative impacts of job stress but also enhance personal well-being and professional capacity. These results hold critical implications for the development of support systems and interventions aimed at fostering resilience and adaptive skills among medical teachers. Such initiatives could potentially improve job satisfaction, mental health, and teaching effectiveness in medical education settings. The study contributes to the growing body of literature on occupational stress and coping mechanisms in the educational sector, particularly within the field of medical education. © 2024 The Authors","China; Extraversion; Job stress; Medical education; Medical teachers' flourishing; Neuroticism; Readiness to change","","","","","","Henan University of Chinese Medicine Education and Teaching Reform Research and Practice Key Project, (2021JX40, 2021JX93)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Henan University of Chinese Medicine Education and Teaching Reform Research and Practice Key Project research on A Study on the Correlation between Motivation for Changing Majors and Time Management Tendency under the Background of College System taking the example of the School of Rehabilitation Medicine.

Descriptive research designed guided the study with 1067 participants drawn through multistage sampling procedure. Cybersecurity and examination breaches on large-scale educational assessment questionnaire (CEBLSEA-Q) was used for data collection. The internal consistency reliability index of the instrument was evaluated to be.78 using Cronbach alpha method. The findings of the study showed that hacking of websites, colluding via social media (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc.), sending of malicious/phishing links, using man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack are some of the cyberattacks on large-scale educational assessments. The proportion of examination breaches experienced by the various examination bodies was significantly different with WAEC being the highest, followed by NECO, JAMB, and NABTEB. Cybersecurity measures such as cloud computing, securing domain name server (DNS), encrypting computers and applications containing assessment database, cybersecurity awareness, among others could curb cyberspace aided examination breaches on educational assessments. Cybersecurity measures should be adopted by large-scale educational agencies in order to curb examination breaches that are aided through the cyberspace. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cybercrime/cyberattack;

However, to establishing the classification algorithm, an imbalance was evidenced in the amounts of opinions that qualify the teaching performance with the satisfied and dissatisfied class. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to determine the improvement in the performance of the student satisfaction classification algorithm, based on the class balancing method from the application of the minority synthetic oversampling technique (SMOTE). From the methodological point of view, the research is a non-experimental design, applied type, and quantitative approach. The data was collected through the social network Twitter for fifteen weeks to a population defined by mechanical and electrical engineering students. After the application of the SMOTE data balancing technique, it was identified that the algorithm which presents the best performance is Logistic Regression. It was possible to identify that the impact of improvement of the algorithm turned out to be an average of 2.17% in the accuracy, 84.78% in precision, 42% in the Recall (Sensitivity) and 58.33% in the F1-score. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the algorithm classifies with high probability the opinions of the students. © 2023 by the authors.","classification algorithm; oversampling; Performance; student satisfaction; teacher performance","","","","","","","","Villasmil B.

This field represents a fusion of art and technology, requiring a high degree of artistic sensitivity. However, in the education and teaching of digital media technology, educators have consistently focused on how to promote the effects of students’ artistic thinking and behavior in the educational environment. In 2020, Mianyang Normal University in China began implementing the “triggered teaching behavior” strategy in its education and teaching. Through this research, we aim to explore the enhancement of teaching and learning effectiveness by using triggered teaching behavior. Method: The study involved 46 students from the digital media technology program and 45 students from the visual communication design program. Data analysis methods included tools such as SPSS and SEM-AMOS. Result and Conclusion: The results showed that art students had a higher level of artistic thinking. There was no difference in artistic thinking between digital media technology students and visual communication design students. Our results suggest that triggered teaching behavior can instigate beneficial changes in the educational context. Educators should use this teaching strategy to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness. © 2024, Artseduca.

This paper takes the first-year freshmen of Guangzhou Institute of Commerce and Industry as the research object, and investigates the effects of students' individual characteristics, family support, learning motivation, learning methods, school teaching quality, learning environment, social factors, learning resources and technology, learning attitudes and emotions, rewards and feedback, learning community and cooperation, school management and leadership, and social support on students' performance in the National Computer Grade Examination.Data on exam results were collected through questionnaires, and several artificial intelligence algorithms were used to comprehensively analyze the effects of single, multiple, and combined factors on performance. The results of the study show that there is a positive correlation between students' academic performance and the intensity of their curiosity; girls of average height tend to perform better academically than boys; students whose parents are more educated, value education, and invest heavily in education tend to perform better academically; students who grow up immersed in digital media show greater enthusiasm for learning; Students whose family members emphasize a balanced diet and physical fitness; students whose family members emphasize a balanced diet and good health also perform better academically; students who are able to adapt to a variety of teaching methods, use a variety of educational resources, and plan their learning process better; and students who are good at integrating a variety of educational resources and learning strategies also show higher levels of academic achievement. This study provides direction for educators and effective strategies for improving student performance on computer-based tests. © 2024 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; student performance","Adversarial machine learning;

This mode brings unique challenges for teachers that require specific professional digital competences. One such challenge is conducting formative assessment. Through the use of in-depth interviews with nine Hong Kong university teachers who had taught synchronously online for one semester, this exploratory study explored the challenges of conducting formative assessment during synchronous online lessons and the strategies teachers deploy to conduct formative assessment. The findings indicate that the key difficulties include gathering information on students’ needs, checking students’ understanding, giving individual feedback, and building relationships with students. To address these challenges, the teachers suggested four pedagogical strategies: (1) Combine synchronous with asynchronous approaches; (2) Utilise breakout rooms; (3) Utilise poll functions of the VCS and combine it with other online platforms; and (4) Provide time before or after lessons for informal conversations. The findings suggest that teachers need to develop specific pedagogical strategies to conduct formative assessment. This provides an initial conceptualisation of one important dimension of Professional Digital Competence, teaching using digital technologies, and one aspect of that dimension, how teachers use digital tools and strategies to conduct formative assessment. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19;

New assessment models built on the proliferation of smartphones, social networks and software developments are opening up new horizons in the field. Method: This study is divided into four sections, each discussing the benefits and limitations of a specific type of technology-based assessment: ambulatory assessment, social networks, gamification and forced-choice testing. Results: The latest developments are clearly relevant in the field of psychological and educational measurement and assessment. Among other benefits, they bring greater ecological validity to the assessment process and eliminate the bias associated with retrospective assessment. Conclusions: Some of these new approaches point to a multidisciplinary scenario with a tradition which has yet to be created. Psychometrics must secure a place in this new world by contributing sound expertise in the measurement of psychological variables. The challenges and debates facing the field of psychology as it incorporates these new approaches are also discussed. © 2023, Colegio Oficial de Psicologos Asturias.

Specifically, this study distinguishes the impact of social-oriented (SO-SMU) and job-oriented (JO-SMU) on teachers' research performance and teaching performance, respectively. This study collected data from 286 respondents from multiple private universities in Henan Province through a questionnaire survey and used quantitative analysis methods and SPSS to conduct reliability, validity, and correlation analysis on the data. Finally, linear regression was used to explore the relationship between variables. The study found that both SO-SMU and JO-SMU have a significant positive impact on teaching performance. However, both SO-SMU and JO-SMU have a certain negative impact on research performance. Excessive or improper SMU will distract teachers from scientific research activities, resulting in a decrease in scientific research efficiency. Therefore, teachers in private universities in Henan Province should actively use social media to improve their teaching performance. At the same time, university teachers should also reduce the negative impact of social media on scientific research performance, consider changing the way social media is used, and explore other channels to improve scientific research. © 2025 by the authors.","JO-SMU; Private university teachers; Research performance; SO-SMU; Teaching performance","","","","","","","","Valkenburg P.

This paper delves into the utilization of smart contracts as a means to revolutionize the monitoring and execution of online examinations, thereby guaranteeing the traceability of evaluation data and examinee activities. In this context, the integration of advanced technologies such as the PoseNet algorithm, derived from the TensorFlow Model, emerges as a pivotal component. By leveraging PoseNet, the system adeptly identifies both single and multiple faces of examinees, thereby ensuring the authenticity and integrity of examination sessions. Moreover, the incorporation of the COCO dataset facilitates the recognition of objects within examination environments, further bolstering the system's capabilities in monitoring examinee activities.of paramount importance is the secure storage of evidence collected during examinations, a task efficiently accomplished through the implementation of the blockchain technology. This platform not only ensures the immutability of data but also safeguards against potential instances of tampering, thereby upholding the credibility of examination results. Through the utilization of smart contracts, the proposed framework not only streamlines the examination process but also instills transparency and integrity, thereby addressing inherent challenges encountered in traditional examination methods. One of the key advantages of this technological integration lies in its ability to modernize examination procedures while concurrently reinforcing trust and accountability within the educational assessment ecosystem. By harnessing the power of smart contracts, educational institutions can mitigate concerns pertaining to data manipulation and malpractice, thereby fostering a more secure and reliable examination environment. Furthermore, the transparency afforded by blockchain technology ensures that examination outcomes are verifiable and auditable, instilling confidence among stakeholders and enhancing the overall credibility of the assessment process. In conclusion, the adoption of smart contracts represents a paradigm shift in the realm of educational assessment, offering a comprehensive solution to the challenges posed by traditional examination methods. By embracing advanced technologies such as PoseNet and blockchain, educational institutions can not only streamline examination procedures but also uphold the highest standards of integrity and accountability. As such, the integration of smart contracts holds immense potential in shaping the future of online examinations, paving the way for a more efficient, transparent, and trustworthy assessment ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain technology; integration; PoseNet; Smart contracts; TensorFlow model","Advanced technology; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Educational assessment; Educational institutions; Examination methods; Online examinations; Online tests; Posenet; Tensorflow model; Data integrity","","","","","","","Aishwarya S., Ramya S., Subhiksha S., Samundeswari S., Detection of impersonation in online examinations using blockchain, 2020 International Conference on Power, Energy, Control and Transmission Systems (ICPECTS), pp. 1-5, (2020); Chen N., David S.-Y.C., A blockchain based autonomous decentralized online social network, 2021 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics and Computer Engineering (ICCECE), pp. 186-190, (2021); Diwakar K.M., Alfatmi K., New approach for online examination conduction system using smart contract, 2021 10th IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT), pp. 848-852, (2021); Zhang P., A video-based face detection and recognition system using cascade face verification modules, 2008 37th IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop, pp. 1-8, (2008); Jain A., Kumar Tripathi A., Chandra N., Chinnasamy P., Smart contract enabled online examination system based in blockchain network, 2021 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), pp. 1-7, (2021); Li Q., Yang C., College english online examination system design based on cloud computing platform, 2020 International Conference on Big Data and Informatization Education (ICBDIE), pp. 350-353, (2022); Ranjan R., Et al., 1, 2, pp. 82-96, (2019); Zheng W., Bhandarkar S.M., A boosted adaptive particle filter for face detection and tracking, 2006 International Conference on Image Processing, pp. 2821-2824, (2006); Nandy A., A densenet based robust face detection framework, 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshop (ICCVW), pp. 1840-1847, (2019); Yang X.Y., Liang N.N., Zhou W., Lu H.M., A face detection method based on skin color model and improved AdaBoost algorithm, Traitement du Signal, 37, 6, pp. 929-937, (2020)","M.D. Kulkarni; Dept. of Computer Engg, SVKM's Institute of Technology, Dhule, India; email: mayuridkulkarni@gmail.com","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03064379","","INSYD","","English","Inf.

Employing social capital theory, we investigate the mechanisms through which social media usage affects organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) of faculty in Kenyan private universities. OCB is an important aspect of universities’ performance, given the high level of autonomy in universities. We develop a theoretical model that posits direct links to OCB of three social media usages (social, cognitive, and hedonic) which affect OCB. We also posit indirect links (using autonomy as a mediator) that affect faculty’s intrinsic motivation for OCB. Using descriptive cross-sectional survey, a mediated model was tested on 388 faculty. Results revealed: 1) social media usage significantly impacts OCB, with social and cognitive having a positive relationship, and hedonic having a negative relationship with OCB; 2) social media usage tends to increase autonomy.

However, this transition has also impacted the preparation of pre-service teachers, who receive training to become licensed or certified teachers. This study investigates the influence of online education on the academic experiences of 130 pre-service teachers attending the Postgraduate Diploma Program at Al Ain University in the UAE. It also explores the relationships between pre-service teachers’ demographics and five academic experiences. A quantitative questionnaire consisting of five newly-developed scales was used for data collection. Pre-service teachers’ demographics were found not to impact effective teaching and learning, skill development, or satisfaction. Age and employment status were found not to influence pre-service teachers’ views of faculty online assessment and feedback or course organization and management. However, online course organization and management and faculty online assessment and feedback were significantly correlated with marital status as engagement and motivation with employment status was, but not with age or marital status. Effective teaching and learning, faculty assessment, and feedback positively impacted pre-service teachers’ engagement and motivation, while effective teaching and learning and course organization correlated with pre-service teachers’ skill development and satisfaction. Research on online education and pre-service teachers’ experiences post-pandemic is limited. Thus, future studies should explore this relationship to understand better pre-service teachers’ online learning experiences, involvement, and success.

This high-stakes task is one of a growing number of requirements to come out of the standards and accountability regime as outlined in the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) document for accreditation for ITE programmes. We delve into the public commentary about the broader commission of preservice and graduate teacher quality in general and the TPA in particular. We draw on Bernstein’s pedagogic identities and deductively apply this theory to explore this phenomenon. We use a data set of publicly available legacy media and social media tweets made over a ten-month period from August 2019 to May 2020 to reveal the focus, inherent bias and pedagogic identities promoted by these public discourses. The paper concludes with discussion about the implications of these drivers on the public perception of quality in ITE and on the status of teaching more broadly. © Crown 2023.","Accreditation; Initial teacher education; Legacy media; Social media; Teacher quality; Teaching performance assessment","","","","","","Griffith University Arts, Education and Law Group","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

In order to quantify the effectiveness of knowledge transmission and mastery in digital media teaching, this paper proposes an improved Bayesian knowledge tracking model (BF-BKT), which has been specifically optimized for teaching quality evaluation. The motivation stems from the shortcomings of existing technology in evaluating teaching quality, especially the lack of effective integration of student learning behavior and forgetting patterns. This article describes the development process of the BF-BKT model, which innovatively combines learning behavior data and forgetting patterns by introducing behavioral forgetting features to more accurately predict students’ learning status and teaching effectiveness. The BF-BKT model not only considers whether students have mastered a certain knowledge point, but also further analyzes their forgetting situation at different time points, providing a more comprehensive perspective for evaluating teaching quality. To validate the performance of the BF-BKT model, we compared it with the traditional BKT model and two diverse BKT variants. We conducted systematic experiments and analysis by selecting public datasets as simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the BF-BKT model performs well in predicting students’ knowledge mastery and evaluating teaching quality, and its performance is superior to other comparative methods, proving the effectiveness and superiority of the model. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian knowledge tracking; behavioral modeling; teaching quality evaluation","Adversarial machine learning; Bayesian; Bayesian knowledge tracking; Behavioral model; Learning behavior; Performance; Quality evaluation; Student learning; Teaching quality; Teaching quality evaluation; Tracking models; Contrastive Learning","","","","","Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund Project: Digital restoration of temple murals and construction of virtual museum in Shaanxi temple, (22022J026)","This work was supported by Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund Project: Digital restoration of temple murals and construction of virtual museum in Shaanxi temple (No. 22022J026).","Guo Z., Yu K., Bashir A.K., Zhang D., Al-Otaibi Y.D., Guizani M., Deep information fusion-driven POI scheduling for mobile social networks, IEEE Netw, 36, 4, pp. 210-216, (2022); Hong J.-W., Curran N.M., Artificial intelligence, artists, and art: Attitudes toward artwork produced by humans vs. Artificial intelligence, ACM Trans.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: Teachers' assessment of the mental health of high schoolers with SEN was conducted through an anonymous survey of teachers using the questionnaire developed by the authors. The research, conducted in 2023, involved 739 teachers working with high schoolers (ages 6-10) with SEN. RESULTS: Results: It was found that 32.3 % of high schoolers were in the combat zone or on the temporarily occupied territory; 31.7 % of high schoolers were forced to leave their homes and were temporarily displaced, 17.7 % went through a separation from their parents, 15.8 % witnessed hostilities, and 3.8 % suffered bullying from their peers. In the educational process, high schoolers with SEN most often experienced anxiety (55.2 %), ""emotional swings"" (48.4 %), restlessness (44.8 %), fear (37.2 %). During the 1.5 years of war, 15.4 % of high schoolers began to study worse, 12.9 % began to spend more time playing computer games and on social media. It was found that 59.9 % of teachers need more information on maintaining the mental health of high schoolers with SEN. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The results obtained proved the negative impact of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine on the mental health of high schoolers with SEN, which necessitates the provision of adequate psychological support by teachers of such high schoolers in the educational process.","  children with special educational needs;   mental health;   psychological assistance;   teachers;   war in Ukraine","Adolescent; Child; Education, Special; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; School Teachers; Surveys and Questionnaires; Ukraine; Warfare; adolescent; child; female; human; male; mental health; psychology; questionnaire; school teacher; special education; Ukraine; warfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","00435147","","","39106383","English","Wiad Lek","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200828422"

On the basis of existing scholars' influence evaluation algorithms at home and abroad, this article designs a scholar influence evaluation approach and algorithm based on open peer review. That is, the qualitative content of open peer review in scholar articles is processed by certain artificial intelligence technology to form multiple label sets that can represent the influence of scholars from different dimensions, thus exploring the multi angle evaluation of scholar influence from a quality perspective. Finally, this article conducts empirical research and comparative analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using the open peer review platform F1000 as the data source platform. Empirical research has shown that the algorithm proposed in this article provides a new perspective and approach for evaluating the influence of scholars, which can preliminarily achieve multidimensional evaluation of scholars, endow scholars with personal academic profiles, and enhance the fullness and recognition of scholar influence. Comparative analysis shows that this algorithm does not have a significant correlation with bibliometric evaluation algorithms and can serve as a supplement to the existing evaluation system. The combination of traditional bibliometric analysis algorithms and open peer review based algorithms will be the future development trend of academic evaluation. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","artificial intelligence; evaluation; f1000; open peer review; scholar influence","Comparative analyzes; Continuous development; Empirical research; Evaluation; Evaluation algorithm; F1000; Influence evaluation; Open peer review; Peer review; Scholar influence","","","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; University of International Relations, UIR, (3262024T60); University of International Relations, UIR","This study supported by Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities, University of International Relations (3262024T60).","Open peer review: Would you choose?, (2024); McCormack N., Peer review and legal publishing: what law librarians need to know about open, single-blind, and double blind reviewing[J], Law library journal, 101, 1, pp. 59-70, (2009); Lijuan Z., Mu L., Shanshan Y., The concept definition, type construction, and expert acceptance re exploration of open peer review in journals[J], Chinese Journal of Science and Technology Research, 33, 1, pp. 31-39, (2022); Shotton D., The five stars of online journal articles-a framework for article evaluation, (2024); Perakakis P., Taylor M., Mazza M., Et al., Understanding the role of open peer review and dynamic academic articles[J], Scientometrics, 88, 2, pp. 669-673, (2011); Chunli L., A method for evaluating the influence of scientific papers based on soft peer review: F1000 factor[J], Chinese Journal of Science and Technology Research, 23, 3, pp. 383-386, (2012); Chunlin J., Liwei Z., Xue L., Research Status and Issues of Peer Review in China and Foreign Countries[J], Chinese Journal of Science and Technology Research, 3, pp. 163-166, (2015); Ford E., Defining and characterizing open peer review: a review of the literature[J], Journal of scholarly publishing, 44, 4, pp. 311-326, (2013); Chenglei Q., Chengzhi Z., Issues and Countermeasures Faced by Peer Review in the Big Data Environment[J], Intelligence Theory and Practice, 44, 4, pp. 99-112, (2021); Xiaolin L., Research on the Distribution and Development of Ba Yu Literature during the Republic of China Period Based on Lotka's Law[J], Library Journal, 6, pp. 66-72, (2020); Hirsch J., An index to quantify an individual's scientific research output[J], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 102, 46, pp. 16569-16572, (2005); Ali M.J., Understanding the 'g-index' and the 'e-index'[J], Seminars in Ophthalmology, 36, 4, (2021); Zhang C.T., The e-index, complementing the h-index for excess citation[J], PLoS ONE, 4, 5, pp. 1-4, (2009); Mingkun W., Research on Scholar's Diachronic Influence Based on H-Index Correction[J], Modern Intelligence, 41, 1, pp. 152-157, (2021); Lei Z., Xiangrong S., Ruina S., The Opinion Leader Discovery Model Based on LeaderRank and Its Application[J], Intelligence Journal, 40, 4, pp. 194-199, (2021); Jingjing K., Research on the Progress of Influence Evaluation of Chinese Scholars[J], Intelligence Exploration, 1, 11, pp. 129-134, (2017); H-index and variants, (2024); Xie Ruixia Research on Author Influence Evaluation Based on”Thesis” and”Co authorship Network”[D], (2019); Jinxing C., Xiaoguang W., Lv Tao Research on the coverage and correlation of alternative measurement indicators[J], Digital Library Forum, 2, pp. 59-66, (2020); Xiaoling S., Yong X., Weizhong Y., Research on the Comprehensive Evaluation of Academic Influence of Scientific and Technological Papers Based on Network Bibliometrics[J], Library and Information Work, 57, 21, pp. 95-103, (2013); F1000 Prime-faqs, (2023); F1000 Prime-classifications, (2023); Lolle S.J., Victor J.L., Young J.M., Et al., Genome-wide non-mendelian inheritance of extra-genomic informationin arabidopsis[J], Nature, 434, 7032, pp. 505-509, (2005)","J.

Recent advancements in sentiment analysis provide new avenues for evaluating student feedback, particularly through informal channels such as social media. While formal student evaluations offer structured feedback on teaching styles, they may not fully capture the nuanced opinions and sentiments expressed by students in informal settings, such as social media. This research aims to address the gap by integrating sentiment analysis of social media data to evaluate teaching effectiveness across various styles and comparing it with formal evaluation results. This study employs sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to analyze student posts on social media platforms. The analysis includes the extraction of sentiment distributions, identification of common keywords, and tracking of sentiment trends over time. Additionally, formal student evaluations (Likert scale) are collected to offer a direct comparison. The teaching styles analyzed include lecture-based teaching, project-based learning, flipped classrooms, online learning, hybrid learning, and traditional exam-based learning. The findings demonstrate that student sentiment varies significantly across teaching styles. Flipped classrooms and project-based learning received the highest positive sentiment scores, while traditional exam-based teaching showed the most negative sentiment. Social media feedback tended to align with formal evaluations for certain teaching styles, such as the flipped classroom and hybrid learning but showed divergence in others, like online learning, which received higher sentiment in social media feedback. Trends over time reveal evolving sentiments, with fluctuating satisfaction as the academic semester progressed. The integration of social media sentiment analysis provides a more dynamic and real-time understanding of student experiences, offering deeper insights into teaching style effectiveness. © 2025, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

Compared with the traditional single-teacher classroom, the interaction has the characteristics of multi-objects in BSC. The teacher-student dialogue directly influences the teaching effectiveness of such classrooms. However, most existing research focuses on counting the frequency of teacher-student interaction, in similar teaching activities, which might overlook the quality and depth of teacher-student dialogue. To fill this gap, this research uses a variety of learning analytics and data mining methods (e.g., lag sequence analysis, social network analysis and K-means) to detect fine-grained attributes of transitions of teacher-student dialogue in 40 BSC lessons, based on Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives theory. The results show two kinds of classroom dialogue characteristics, as well as the transformation characteristics of questioning behaviors and the key questioning behaviors. This research deepens the understanding of the diversity of teacher-student dialogue and offers practical implications for improving the quality of classroom dialogue in BSC. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Blended synchronous classroom; Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives; Classroom dialogue; Dual-teacher instruction","Behavioral research; Blooms (metal); Data mining; K-means clustering; Taxonomies; Blended synchronoi classroom; Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objective; Classroom dialog; Dual-teacher instruction; Educational objectives; Synchronous classrooms; Teachers'; Urban and rural; Urban educations; Urban-rural; Students","","","","","","","Luo G., Zeng S., Balezentis T., Multidimensional measurement and comparison of China’s educational inequality, Soc.

Despite the availability of a rich collection of published research on women faculty that has increasingly used an intersectional lens, these conversations rarely meaningfully address strategies to make faculty careers more welcoming and accessible to women with disabilities. Further, as the professoriate ages, there will be an increasing number of faculty with disabilities, and the pandemic has a disproportionate impact on many faculty with disabilities. In the coming years, there will also be faculty who have acquired disabilities as the result of long COVID. This paper reviews existing research and known practices related to faculty with disabilities, as well as reports from people with disabilities and other stakeholders in an online community, and offers practical promising practices for increasing the participation of this marginalized and underserved group in STEM fields. The paper begins with a discussion of structural barriers that make faculty careers inaccessible and unwelcoming to people with disabilities and presents two approaches to access: accommodations and universal design. Both approaches are important for increasing the participation of people with disabilities in faculty careers. Given the relatively sparse literature on the topic, we encourage researchers addressing faculty careers to ask about disability in their work and to analyze disability-related data to increase our understanding of the issues impacting this population. Moreover, we offer departments and institutions strategies that they can take related to institutional and departmental policies related to accommodation requests, hiring practices, faculty evaluation, and other relevant areas; departmental culture; physical environments; collaboration and communication, and information technology. We conclude with recommendations to researchers and practitioners regarding the development of practices that will lead to increased engagement and success of women in faculty positions in STEM, as well as, given the relatively sparse literature on the topic, encouragement to researchers addressing faculty careers to ask about disability in their work and to analyze disability-related data to increase our understanding of the issues impacting this population. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.","","Engineering education; Population statistics; Engineering and mathematics; Engineering fields; Ethnic minorities; Mathematic fields; On-line communities; People with disabilities; Science technologies; Technology fields; Universal Design; Women faculty; Professional aspects","","","","","","","Hamrick K., Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering, NSF; Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering, (2015); Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering, (2011); Aquino K.

The study involved 165 participants, consisting of students in grades 3–6, aged between 8 to 12 years, from a suburban primary school in Beijing. The CLEP combines individual and group evaluations, focusing on both academic and social performance. Students’ daily self-assessments, mutual assessments, and teachers’ assessments were collected to assess their performance in cooperative learning. The evaluation scores indicated a significant improvement in social interaction behaviour after the implementation of the CLEP. The CLEP implementation resulted in enhanced class cohesion and increased gender-heterogeneous friendships. Students viewed the CLEP positively, perceiving it as beneficial for their interpersonal skills. The findings suggest that educational psychologists can utilise cooperative learning strategies to improve classroom engagement, interaction, and interpersonal relationships among students. © 2025 Association of Educational Psychologists.","class cohesion; Cooperative learning evaluation programme; gender- heterogeneous friendships; social interaction; social network analysis","","","","","","","","Abramczyk A., Jurkowski S., Cooperative learning as an evidence-based teaching strategy: What teachers know, believe, and how they use it, Journal of Education for Teaching, 46, 3, pp. 296-308, (2020); Baines E., Blatchford P., Kutnick P., Changes in grouping practices over primary and secondary school, International Journal of Educational Research, 39, 1-2, pp. 9-34, (2003); Berdan L.E., Keane S.P., Calkins S.D., Temperament and externalizing behavior: Social preference and perceived acceptance as protective factors, Developmental Psychology, 44, 4, (2008); Buchs C., Filippou D., Pulfrey C., Volpe Y., Challenges for cooperative learning implementation: Reports from elementary school teachers, Journal of Education for Teaching, 43, 3, pp. 296-306, (2017); Davidson S.L., Mental health in Chinese schools: Adapting global paradigms in policy and practice, (2015); Double K.S., McGrane J.A., Hopfenbeck T.N., The impact of peer assessment on academic performance: A meta-analysis of control group studies, Educational Psychology Review, 32, 2, pp. 481-509, (2020); Dzemidzic Kristiansen S., Burner T., Johnsen B.H., Face-to-face promotive interaction leading to successful cooperative learning: A review study, Cogent Education, 6, 1, (2019); Collaborative learning approaches, Education Endowment Foundation, (2021); Fabes R.A., Martin C.L., Hanish L.D., Gender integration and the promotion of inclusive classroom climates, Educational Psychologist, 54, 4, pp. 271-285, (2019); Fabes R.A., Martin C.L., Hanish L.D., Gender integration and the promotion of inclusive classroom climates, Educational Psychologist, 54, 4, pp. 271-285, (2019); Freeman L.C., Centrality in social networks: Conceptual clarification, Social Networks, 1, 3, pp. 215-239, (1978); Genc M., An evaluation of the cooperative learning process by sixth-grade students, Research in Education, 95, 1, pp. 19-32, (2015); Gillies R.M., Cooperative learning: Developments in research, International Journal of Educational Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 125-140, (2014); Gillies R.M., Millis B., Davidson N., Contemporary global perspectives on cooperative learning: Applications across educational contexts, (2023); James M., Pollard A., TLRP’s ten principles for effective pedagogy: Rationale, development, evidence, argument and impact, Principles for effective pedagogy, pp. 6-59, (2014); Kingery J.N., Erdley C.A., Marshall K.C., Peer acceptance and friendship as predictors of early adolescents’ adjustment across the middle school transition, Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 57, 3, pp. 215-243, (2011); Kyndt E., Raes E., Lismont B., Timmers F., Cascallar E., Dochy F., A meta-analysis of the effects of face-to-face cooperative learning.

The study adhered to the CONSORT guidelines. Participants (N = 283) were cluster-randomized into two groups: a blended teaching group (n = 76) receiving self-management activities via WeChat Moments alongside teachers, and a traditional teaching group (n = 207) receiving teacher-based instruction. A battery of survey items was meticulously analyzed, including demographics, educational quality, self-directed learning ability, and the willingness to further study in the nutrition course. Additionally, chapter test scores, final examination grades, nutritional counseling capabilities, and final course grades were evaluate. Blended teaching significantly improved the chapter test average (P = 0.018), willingness to continue learning (P = 0.018), students’ evaluation of teaching quality (P = 0.027), and nutritional counseling capabilities (P < 0.001); however, no differences were observed in final exam grades (P = 0.620) or final course grades (P = 0.951). Our research findings clearly show that combining blended teaching with real-life scenarios significantly benefits educational quality. It boosts students’ willingness to keep learning, their evaluation of teaching quality, and their self-directed learning awareness, and also favorably impacts the development of their nutritional counseling capabilities. © The Author(s) 2025.","Blended nutrition education; Educational quality; Nursing student; Nutritional counseling capabilities; Real-life scenarios","Adult; Counseling; Education, Nursing; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Nutritional Sciences; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; adult; article; awareness; blended learning; clinical practice guideline; controlled study; female; human; learning; major clinical study; male; nursing student; nutrition; nutrition education; nutritional counseling; practice guideline; self care; self-directed learning; social media; teacher; teaching; counseling; education; nursing education; nutritional science; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; young adult","","","","","Anhui Provincial Quality Engineering Project, (2023ylyjh046, 2022jyxm1699, 2020jyxm2086, 2023cxtd170); Anhui Provincial Quality Engineering Project; Wannan Medical College Quality Engineering, (2021jyxm43)","The authors would like to thank all students, who volunteered to participate in the study.

This study explores the implementation of peer review as an interactive learning approach within these digital environments. Primarily, it focuses on addressing the challenges of inconsistent evaluation standards and inaccurate cognitive diagnostics, which have historically limited the effectiveness of peer review in educational assessments. This study aims to enhance the accuracy and fairness of peer review in online education. Two models are proposed: a Fuzzy Cognitive Diagnostic Framework (Fuzzy-CDF) and a weighted PageRank peer review model. The Fuzzy-CDF is designed to evaluate students’ learning abilities and knowledge mastery with greater precision. Conversely, the weighted PageRank model leverages social media interaction data to assess students’ influence in peer review, aiming for more equitable evaluation outcomes. Through these methodologies, it has been found that issues of inconsistent evaluation standards and inaccuracies in cognitive diagnostics can be effectively addressed, thereby improving the effectiveness of peer review. The main conclusion drawn is that these models not only enhance the operationality and accuracy of peer review but also offer new perspectives and methods for educational assessment in social media contexts, holding theoretical and practical value in advancing educational technology. © The Author(s) 2024.","cognitive diagnosis; Fuzzy-CDF model; peer review; social media platforms; weighted PageRank","Cognitive diagnosis; Educational assessment; Evaluation standard; Framework models; Fuzzy cognitive diagnostic framework model; Page ranks; Peer review; Social media; Social media platforms; Weighted pagerank; Cloud platforms","","","","","","","Tafesse W., Korneliussen T., On the collective efficacy of social media teams, Market Intell Plann, 39, 3, pp. 438-453, (2021); Hogan M., Strasburger V.C., Social media and new technology: a primer, Clin Pediatr, 57, 10, pp. 1204-1215, (2018); Li W.B., Cho H., Modifiable factors associated with social media addiction: gratifications sought, social media realism, and social network characteristics, Commun Rep, 36, 2, pp. 69-81, (2023); Trethewey S.P., Medical misinformation on social media: cognitive bias, pseudo-peer review, and the good intentions hypothesis, Circulation, 140, 14, pp. 1131-1133, (2019); Lapena J.F., Munk P.L., Saw A., Et al., Perspectives on double‐blind peer review from collectivist cultural contexts, Med J Aust, 210, 8, pp. 347-348, (2019); Poole D., De Jong A., Citerio G., Multistakeholder social media peer review and fixing slips, Intensive Care Med, 48, 7, pp. 923-925, (2022); Hoang L.P., Le H.T., Van Tran H., Et al., Does evaluating peer assessment accuracy and taking it into account in calculating assessor’s final score enhance online peer assessment quality?, Educ Inf Technol, 27, pp. 4007-4035, (2022); Cheong C.M., Luo N., Zhu X., Et al., Self-assessment complements peer assessment for undergraduate students in an academic writing task, Assess Eval High Educ, 48, 1, pp. 135-148, (2023); Qiao L., Wang Z., Bao S., Et al., Analysis and reflection on peer assessment results based on short play of game theory, Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag, 11, pp. 780-784, (2020); Adachi C., Tai J., Dawson P., A framework for designing, implementing, communicating and researching peer assessment, High Educ Res Dev, 37, 3, pp. 453-467, (2018); To J., Panadero E., Peer assessment effects on the self-assessment process of first-year undergraduates, Assess Eval High Educ, 44, 6, pp. 920-932, (2019); Curran V.R., Fairbridge N.A., Deacon D., Peer assessment of professionalism in undergraduate medical education, BMC Med Educ, 20, 1, pp. 1-8, (2020); Ng W.S., Xie H., Wang F.L., Et al., Peer assessment of peer assessment plan: a deep learning approach of teacher assessment literacy, Int J Innovat Learn, 27, 4, pp. 450-466, (2020); Rico-Juan J.R., Cachero C., Macia H., Influence of individual versus collaborative peer assessment on score accuracy and learning outcomes in higher education: an empirical study, Assess Eval High Educ, 47, 4, pp. 570-587, (2022); Fiedorowicz J.G., Kleinstauber M., Lemogne C., Et al., Peer review as a measurable responsibility of those who publish: the peer review debt index, J Psychosom Res, 161, (2022); Li H., Zhao C., Long T., Et al., Exploring the reliability and its influencing factors of peer assessment in massive open online courses, Br J Educ Technol, 52, 6, pp. 2263-2277, (2021); Dadkhah M., Kahani M., Borchardt G., A method for improving the integrity of peer review, Sci Eng Ethics, 24, 5, pp. 1603-1610, (2018); Hug S.E., Towards theorizing peer review, Quant Sci Stud, 3, 3, pp. 815-831, (2022)","J.

With the development of mathematical science, people have a deeper understanding of it, and the idea of optimization into various fields. Optimization theory has become an important subject in recent years and has been widely used in many important fields. With the improvement of science and technology, computer and network technology has been popularized in every corner of social life. Since the spring of 2020, in the face of the impact of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice of 'using online platforms to suspend classes without stopping school', and large, primary and secondary schools across the country are taking part in online teaching. The implementation of online teaching has rapidly changed the teaching methods of teachers and students. The changes of learning environment, learning platform and teaching methods have also brought new challenges to teachers. Therefore, in order to solve the problems accompanying online teaching, improve the effect of online teaching of mathematics, in order to help mathematics teachers more accurate and efficient online teaching work. In this paper, an online mathematics teaching quality testing system based on optimization algorithm is proposed. The AMM algorithm is used in the numerical experiment. Thirdly, the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with the classical gradient descent optimization algorithm, which proves that the algorithm is feasible and efficient. The experimental results show that the combination of optimization algorithm and big data technology can better realize the online teaching quality detection, but also help students to obtain better learning experience and effect.  © 2023 IEEE.","AMM algorithm; mathematics online teaching; optimization algorithm; quality test","Computer aided instruction; Coronavirus; E-learning; Engineering education; Gradient methods; Learning systems; Optimization; Teaching; AMM algorithm; Mathematic online teaching; Online teaching; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Quality test; Teachers'; Teaching methods; Teaching quality; Test systems; Site selection","","","","","Xi'an Innovation College of Yan'an University, (ZYRC202208)","Fund 2: The project of Xi'an Innovation College of Yan'an University for cultivating outstanding talents (Project No. ZYRC202208).","OmaeY M.M., Akiduki T., Et al., A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM FOR HUMAN MOTIONS ANOMALY DETECTION, International Journal of Innovative Computing Information and Control, 15, 1, pp. 199-208, (2019); Al-Andoli M., Cheah W.P., Tan S.C., Deep autoencoder-based community detection in complex networks with particle swarm optimization and continuation algorithms, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 1, pp. 1-17, (2021); Mu R., Multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithm based on decomposition for community detection in complex networks, Soft computing: A fusion of foundations, methodologies and applications, 59, 26, pp. 12136-12143, (2019); Shao B., Jinneng H.E., Bian G., Research on Replica Layout Algorithm Based on Multi-objective Decomposition Strategy, Journal of Frontiers of Computer Science and Technology, 14, 9, pp. 1490-1500, (2020); Soni B., Roy S., Warsi S., Particle Swarm Optimization in Bioinformatics, Image Processing, and Computational Linguistics, International journal of swarm intelligence research, 12, 4, pp. 25-44, (2021); Ali H., Albagul A., Algitta A., Optimization of PID Parameters based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Ball and Beam System, International Journal of Engineering Technologies and Management Research, 18, 11, pp. 147-150, (2018); Sevinc E., Cosar A., An Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of Distributed Database Queries, Computer Journal, 54, 5, pp. 717-725, (2018); Yong L., Qingsong J., Zhongyao L., Zhen W., Xiaoyu L., Qiuyuan F., Rui Z., Huaicheng G., Lake eutrophication responses modeling and watershed management optimization algorithm: A review, Journal of Lake Sciences, 33, 1, pp. 49-63, (2021); Najah W., Solving Job-Shop Scheduling Problem Using a Developed PSO Algorithm, International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), 7, 1, pp. 1845-1848, (2018); Rahimian P., Behnam S., A Novel Data-driven and Feature-based Forecasting Framework for Wasted Water (NRW) Optimization of Network Pressure Management System, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 31, 3, pp. 423-433, (2020); Ahmed G., Sheltami T., Mahmoud A., Et al., IoD swarms collision avoidance via improved particle swarm optimization, Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice, 142, pp. 260-278, (2020); Ijjina E.P., Classification of human actions using pose-based features and stacked auto encoder, Pattern Recognition Letters, 83, pp. 268-277, (2016)","X.

The teaching effectiveness of physiology courses will directly affect students' learning of other medical disciplines. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current situation and changes in physiology teaching over 30 years in Chinese medical schools. Methods: National survey was conducted online on the platform SoJump via WeChat and the web. The head of the physiology department in medical school was asked to indicate the information of physiology education from three periods: 1991–2000, 2001–2010, and 2011–2020. The responses of 80 leaders of the Department of Physiology from mainland Chinese medical schools were included in the study for analysis. Results: The survey showed that the class hours, both of theory and practice, had been decreased. During the past 20 years, the total number of physiology teachers, the number of physiology teachers who had been educated in medical schools, and the number of technicians had been reduced, whereas teachers with doctor’s degrees had been increased. In addition to traditional didactic teaching, new teaching approaches, including problem-based learning/case-based learning/team-based learning, integrated curriculum and formative evaluation systems, had been employed, mostly for more than 5 years, in some medical schools. Conclusion: The present study has provided historical data regarding the current status of physiology education in China and that in the past thirty years by showing that physiology education in China has developed quickly,even it faces many challenges. © The Author(s) 2024.","Case-based learning; Integrated curriculum; Medical education; Physiology; Problem-based learning","China; Curriculum; Educational Personnel; Educational Status; Humans; Students; article; China; curriculum; education; epidemiology; human; leadership; learning; male; medical education; medical school; physician; physiology; problem based learning; social media; teacher; teaching; China; educational status; student; teacher","","","","","Teaching Quality Project of Sun Yat-sen University, (500000–12220011)","This study was supported by Teaching Reform Project from Guangdong Provincial \""New Medical Science\"" Construction Guidance Committee (2023) and Teaching Quality Project of Sun Yat-sen University (500000\u201312220011).

This paper proposes a PPCA teaching model for public relations based on the current and potential demand for public relations talent in the digital media era. Based on the proposed teaching model, the teaching practice is carried out at O University of H City. The research data was collected through questionnaires, and then the experimental data was statistically analyzed using two independent samples of t-tests and regression analysis to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the evaluation of the learning process based on the PPCA teaching model is between ""good""and ""excellent"", and the class that applies this model improves 3.64% more than the class that applies the traditional model in terms of the overall grade, learning attitude and interest, class participation, learning ability, and ability to acquire knowledge. Classes applying this model have higher scores in terms of overall achievement, learning attitude and interest, class participation, learning ability, and ability to acquire knowledge than classes in the traditional model by 3.646-17.856 points, which is superior to some extent. Meanwhile, the student's active learning initiative (0.147) has the greatest influence on the teaching effectiveness of the PPCA teaching model in public relations.

The study employed a descriptive-analytical approach and included a sample of 409 male and female students randomly selected from Jordanian universities in the academic year 2024\2025. A 28-item research instrument was designed to measure the impact of components of the educational system on comprehension of educational content, divided into three dimensions: teaching strategies component (10 items), the role of the teacher component (8 items), and university administration component (10 items) of which constructed according to the five Likert scale. The study results showed that the impact of teaching strategies, the teacher, and university administration on achieving content comprehension was moderate, with the highest impact being achieved by teaching strategies that take into account a variety of learning styles. The preferred learning style was also found to be the most influential factor in content comprehension, while no statistically significant differences were found based on gender or major variables. The study recommended promoting the use of diverse teaching methods and providing appropriate academic support by teachers and university administration to improve EFL students' comprehension of academic content. Moreover, Improve communication between EFL instructors and students through online platforms. Stay current with technological advancements in education to enhance teaching effectiveness.

However, instructors lack the tools to accomplish the overwhelming task of evaluating asynchronous online discussion activities. In this paper we present an approach that uses Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) and the instructor’s keywords to automatically extract codes from a relatively small dataset. We use the generated codes to build an Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) model and compare this model with a previous ENA model built by human coders. The results show that there is no statistical difference between the two models. We present an analysis of these models and discuss the potential use of ENA as a visualization to help instructors evaluating asynchronous online discussions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated Coding; ENA Visualization; Instructor’s Keywords; Unsupervised Learning","E-learning; Machine learning; Social networking (online); Asynchronous online discussion; Automated coding; Dirichlet; Epistemic network analyse visualization; Fundamental tools; Hybrid course; Instructor’s keyword; Network analysis models; Online course; Social interactions; Visualization","","","","","","","Aloni M., Harrington C., Research based practices for improving the effectiveness of asynchronous online discussion boards, Scholarsh.

Drawing upon social exchange theory and cognitive load theory, this study explored the effect of teacher interaction in the class virtual community on student satisfaction. A multi-wave survey including 525 students was conducted. Results showed that teacher interaction in the virtual community has a positive effect on students’ satisfaction by promoting knowledge sharing, but it also has a negative effect on students’ satisfaction by increasing learning pressure. The positive effect of teacher interaction in the virtual community is strong for students who have a high preference for virtual communities, whereas the negative effect is magnified for students who have a low preference for virtual communities. The findings provide a comprehensive picture of the effect of virtual community in enhancing teaching quality and reveal the underlying mechanisms. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","knowledge sharing; learning pressure; satisfaction; student preference; Virtual learning community","","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (20JDSZK142); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (20JDSZK142).","Abeele M.V., De Wolf R., Ling R., Mobile media and social space: How anytime, anyplace connectivity structures everyday life, Media and Communication, 6, 2, pp. 5-14, (2018); Adedoyin O.B., Soykan E., Covid-19 pandemic and online learning: The challenges and opportunities, Interactive Learning Environments, 31, 2, pp. 863-875, (2020); Aiken L.A., West S.G., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Al Rawashdeh A.Z., Mohammed E.Y., Al Arab A.R., Alara M., Al-Rawashdeh B., Al-Rawashdeh B., Advantages and disadvantages of using e-learning in university education: Analyzing students’ perspectives, Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 19, 3, pp. 107-117, (2021); Barker J., Gossman P., The learning impact of a virtual learning environment: Students’ views, Teacher Education Advancement Network Journal (TEAN), 5, 2, pp. 19-38, (2013); Besser A., Flett G.L., Zeigler-Hill V., Adaptability to a sudden transition to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: Understanding the challenges for students, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Psychology, 8, 2, pp. 85-105, (2022); Bringman-Rodenbarger L., Hortsch M., How students choose e-learning resources: The importance of ease, familiarity, and convenience, FASEB BioAdvances, 2, 5, pp. 286-295, (2020); Brislin R.W., Translation and content analysis of oral and written material, Handbook of cross-cultural psychology, pp. 389-444, (1980); Cohen S., Kamarck T., Mermelstein R., A global measure of perceived stress, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 24, 4, pp. 385-396, (1983); Cook K.S., Cheshire C., Rice E.R., Nakagawa S., Social exchange theory, Handbook of social psychology, pp. 61-88, (2013); Cropanzano R., Anthony E.L., Daniels S.R., Hall A.V., Social exchange theory: A critical review with theoretical remedies, Academy of Management Annals, 11, 1, pp. 479-516, (2017); Cropanzano R., Mitchell M.S., Social exchange theory: An interdisciplinary review, Journal of Management, 31, 6, pp. 874-900, (2005); Daniel B.K., Schwier R.A., Ross H.M., Synthesis of the process of learning through discourse in a formal virtual learning community, Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 18, 4, pp. 461-477, (2007); Dung D.T.H., The advantages and disadvantages of virtual learning, IOSR Journal of Research & Method in Education, 10, 3, pp. 45-48, (2020); Eid M.I., Al-Jabri I.M., Social networking, knowledge sharing, and student learning: The case of university students, Computers & Education, 99, pp. 14-27, (2016); Elfaki N.K., Abdulraheem I., Abdulrahim R., Impact of e-learning vs traditional learning on student’s performance and attitude, International Medical Journal, 24, 3, pp. 225-233, (2019); Farh J.L., Hackett R.D., Liang J., Individual-level cultural values as moderators of perceived organizational support-employee outcome relationships in China: Comparing the effects of power distance and traditionality, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 3, pp. 715-729, (2007); Ferri F., Grifoni P., Guzzo T., Online learning and emergency remote teaching: Opportunities and challenges in emergency situations, Societies, 10, 4, (2020); Gouldner A.W., The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement, American Sociological Review, 25, 2, pp. 161-178, (1960); Hassan M.M., Mirza T., Hussain M.W., A critical review by teachers on the online teaching-learning during the COVID-19, International Journal of Education and Management Engineering, 10, 8, pp. 17-27, (2020); Henritius E., Lofstrom E., Hannula M.S., University students’ emotions in virtual learning: A review of empirical research in the 21st century, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 1, pp. 80-100, (2019); Himat A.N., Takal M.H., Hakimi M.F., Afghan students’ satisfaction from online learning during COVID-19 at Kandahar University, Kandahar, Afghanistan, American International Journal of Social Science Research, 6, 1, pp. 16-29, (2021); Hsu M.H., Ju T.L., Yen C.H., Chang C.M., Knowledge sharing behavior in virtual communities: The relationship between trust, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 65, 2, pp. 153-169, (2007); Hung S.-W., Cheng M.-J., Are you ready for knowledge sharing?

The use of digital media technology is more likely to increase students' enthusiasm for learning and enhance the teaching impact. To address language education's shortcomings, this paper utilizes digital media technology to enhance language education through media integration. In order to evaluate the teaching effect of integrating digital media in language teaching, this paper combines the Apriori algorithm and C4.5 algorithm to analyze the knowledge and information about the teaching law and teaching situation from a large number of teaching evaluation results, which is used to judge the effect of the application of digital media in language teaching, after comparing the combination algorithm with the traditional rule-mining algorithm. The Apriori algorithm is applied to secondary school language teaching, incorporating digital media for correlation analysis, and the pre-processed dataset is mined and the quality of language teaching in digital media has a great relationship with the quality of teaching and the content of teaching. In this paper, based on the Apriori-C4.5 mining algorithm, we can analyze the factors associated with teaching effectiveness and propose strategies for digital media application in language education innovation.  © 2024 Yang Yang., published by Sciendo.","Apriori algorithm; Apriori-C4.5 mining algorithm; C4.5 algorithm; Digital media; Language education","Contrastive Learning; Data mining; Students; Apriori; Apriori algorithms; Apriori-c4.5 mining algorithm; C4.5 algorithm; Digital media technologies; Innovative strategies; Language education; Media convergence; Mining algorithms; Teaching methods","","","","","","","Luo W., Berson I.R., Berson M.J., Li H., Are early childhood teachers ready for digital transformation of instruction in Mainland China?

Secondly, use information entropy to calculate the weight of evaluation indicators. Finally, construct a social network model, measure the node intimacy function, and identify important nodes in the social network to optimise the social network model and more accurately evaluate teaching effectiveness. The experimental results show that the highest accuracy value of the method proposed in this paper is 95%, the highest precision value is 72%, and the highest recall value is 92%, all of which are better than existing methods, fully demonstrating the effectiveness of its teaching effectiveness evaluation.

This is because SLI has been pervasively included in the formation of engineering students. More specifically, this review aims to answer: What is the theoretical base of service-learning (SL) experiences? How are internships organized within the engineering programs? What kind of activities are performed? What are the more common learning outcomes and how are they assessed? Where are the SLI activities performed? and; Which are stakeholders for SLI? The articles reviewed in this study were selected from the Web of Science Database. The PRISMA methodology was used to identify, screen, evaluate eligibility, and include the relevant articles for the review. A total of 2969 journal articles and proceeding papers, in English and Spanish, from 2000 to 2023, were screened with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 18 articles that were analyzed. The studies analyzed reveal that the main role of SLI is to train students to address and solve real-world problems, applying their technical knowledge, and as a result, students tend to improve their critical thinking and analytical skills, their social responsibility, and citizen engagement, among other benefits. This is considered important since it relates to their readiness for competent professional practice in a constantly changing labor market. The studies connect the improvement of skills to Robert Bringle's SL experiences, Kolb's experiential learning and John Dewey's experimentalism. The characteristics of the practices and the activities performed differ according to the specific areas of the engineering programs. SL experiences are usually integrated into the programs' curricula, but not always as internships. Regarding location, SLIs are conducted in diverse settings, including university campuses, schools, online platforms, and mostly in community-based environments. The learning outcomes differ from knowledge areas and half of the experiences and the assessment methods vary, with self-assessment via questionnaires being the most prevalent, followed by content assessment and instructor evaluation through written reports. The stakeholders include schools and high schools, non-government organizations, and different spaces from society such as farms, museums or recreation parks. This review contributes to recognizing the role of SLI in fostering professional skills. It provides valuable insights into the perception of students, lecturers and community stakeholders regarding the university's involvement in addressing real-world challenges. The results establish the necessity of refining assessment methods for professional skills since most of them rely on self-assessment and activity reports, and also offer the opportunity to explore the correlation between instructorevaluated skill development and the practical application of technical knowledge in real-world settings. © 2024 IEEE.","engineering curriculum; professional skill; service learning","Behavioral research; Competition; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economic geology; Engineering education; Engineering research; Ergonomics; Geological surveys; Professional aspects; Students; Teaching; Wages; Engineering curriculum; Engineering program; Learning experiences; Learning outcome; Literature reviews; Professional skills; Scoping review; Self-assessment; Service learning; Skills development; Curricula","","","","","","","Di Battista A., Et al., Future of Jobs Report 2023, (2023); Tokunova A., Zvonar V., Polozhentsev D., Pavlova V., Teres Y., Economic Consequences of Artificial Intelligence and Labor Automation: Employment Recovery, Transformation of Labor Markets, and Dynamics of Social Structure in the Context of Digital Transformation, Economic Affairs (New Delhi), 68, 4, pp. 2035-2046, (2023); Thakur R., Chavan M., Vasoya A., Kasturiwale H., Ghosh S., Mishra S., Bridging Academia And Industry: A Study On The Skill Development Effects Of Internships And On-The-Job Training Programs, Educational Administration Theory and Practices, 30, 4, (2024); Zeidan S., Bishnoi M., An Effective Framework for Bridging the Gap between Industry and Academia, International Journal on Emerging Technologies, 11, 3, pp. 454-461, (2020); Shuman L.J., Besterfield-Sacre M., McGourty J., The ABET 'professional skills'-Can they be taught?

Firstly, the FCM algorithm transforms the dataset according to its affiliation degree and constructs a new database. An objective function is established to optimize the classification of organizational information using the correlation between data. Finally, the AHP algorithm is introduced to set indicator weights and factor sets, making the assessment results more hierarchical. The results show that the management platform system constructed in this paper operates stably, keeping the departure rate of university staff at about 5%, and 92% of students believe that the platform can improve teachers' teaching quality.

Four study objectives were stated to guide the research. Four research questions were formulated, and one hypothesis statement was made. A literature review was carried out based on the variables under study, as research gaps were also stated. Method: The study utilize7d the descriptive survey research design. The study population comprised 2,800 academic staff of public tertiary institutions of Cross River State. The sampling techniques adopted for this study were the stratified random sampling technique and the accidental random sampling technique. A total sample of 560 respondents was selected from 2,800 academic staff of public tertiary institutions in Cross River State using 20% of the entire population. A validated 25-item four-point modified Likert scale questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. The face and content validity of the instrument was established by experts in Test and Measurement from the University of Calabar, Calabar-Nigeria. The reliability estimates of 0.89 for the instruments were established using the Cronbach Alpha method. A descriptive analysis of frequency count, percentages, mean, and standard deviation was used to test the research questions. Results: The results obtained from the data analysis revealed that there was a statistically significant joint relationship between the predictor variables (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp) and teachers’ teaching effectiveness in tertiary institutions in Cross River State, Nigeria. Conclusion: From the findings of this study, one can conclude that there was a statistically significant joint relationship between the predictor variables (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp) and teachers teaching effectiveness in tertiary institutions in Cross River State, Nigeria. Key statistical measures, including mean scores, standard deviation, and inferential tests such as Multiple Linear regression, indicate a positive correlation between social media utilization and improved instructional delivery. The findings suggest the need for inclusive digital strategies to maximize learning outcomes, emphasizing the importance of accessible and adaptive teaching approaches. These insights have critical implications for policy formulation, curriculum design, and pedagogical practices in higher education. Recommendation: Based on the result of the study, it was recommended that since the utilization of social sites by teachers improves teaching effectiveness, learning institutions should enact regulations that will govern the proper and positive use of the various types of social media sites among teachers in institutions to promote teachers’ teaching effectiveness. © (2025), (Lifescience Global).

Strategies had to be quickly developed to guarantee the safety of faculty and students, while also adhering to national guidelines to ensure that educational standards were met and students’ graduations and entrance into residency programs were not delayed. This literature review assesses the novel strategies that dental schools created and implemented to teach in a distance-learning platform and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. In addition, this review talks about the lessons learned during the pandemic and the incorporation of successful strategies after the pandemic ended. Methods: This review evaluated the literature using PubMed and ScienceDirect with the following keywords: “teaching strategies,” “dental education,” and “COVID-19.” The search strategy yielded 15 articles that assessed relevant teaching strategies that were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The literature described the swift response of dental institutions in implementing teaching strategies in response to the inability of continuing in-person teaching. An overwhelming majority of institutions moved their didactic lectures to online platforms. Several institutions implemented online simulations with virtual reality models, videos and discussion boards, standardized patient actors, and case-based discussions. Conclusion: Many of the teaching strategies that were implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly effective. Dental schools were able to satisfy Commission on Dental Accreditation standards and meet students’ requirements for graduation during the pandemic despite the rapid and unplanned shift away from in-person instruction and simulation secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2024 American Dental Education Association.","computer-assisted instruction; COVID-19; dental education; distance; distance learning; teaching effectiveness; teaching methods; undergraduate dental","COVID-19; Education, Dental; Education, Distance; Humans; Pandemics; Schools, Dental; Teaching; coronavirus disease 2019; dental education; distance learning; human; pandemic; prevention and control; procedures; teaching","","","","","","","Chang T.Y., Hong G., Paganelli C., Et al., Innovation of dental education during COVID-19 pandemic, J Dent Sci, 16, 1, pp. 15-20, (2021); Iyer P., Aziz K., Ojcius D.M., Impact of COVID-19 on dental education in the United States, J Dent Educ, 84, 6, pp. 718-722, (2020); Santos G.N.M., da Silva H.E.C., Leite A.F., Et al., The scope of dental education during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review, J Dent Educ, 85, 7, pp. 1287-1300, (2021); Farrokhi F., Mohebbi S.Z., Farrokhi F., Khami M.R., Impact of COVID-19 on dental education-a scoping review, BMC Med Educ, 21, 1, (2021); Emami E., COVID-19: perspective of a dean of dentistry, JDR Clin Trans Res, 5, 3, pp. 211-213, (2020); Schlenz M.A., Schmidt A., Wostmann B., Kramer N., Schulz-Weidner N., Students' and lecturers' perspective on the implementation of online learning in dental education due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19): a cross-sectional study, BMC Med Educ, 20, 1, (2020); Quinn B., Field J., Gorter R., Et al., COVID-19: the immediate response of European academic dental institutions and future implications for dental education, Eur J Dent Educ, 24, 4, pp. 811-814, (2020); Machado R.A., Bonan P.R.F., Perez D., Martelli J.H., COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on dental education: discussing current and future perspectives, Braz Oral Res, 34, (2020); Yu-Fong Chang J., Wang L.H., Lin T.C., Cheng F.C., Chiang C.P., Comparison of learning effectiveness between physical classroom and online learning for dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic, J Dent Sci, 16, 4, pp. 1281-1289, (2021); Gyurko R., Neste C., Dragan I.F., Transitioning clinical rotations to a virtual experience: problem, solution, and results, J Dent Educ, 85, S1, pp. 896-898, (2020); Moore Z., Stallard J., Tittemore A., Lee J.Y., The COVID-19 pandemic: opportunity for integration of educational technology, J Dent Educ, (2020); Omar H., Archer L., Schroeder K., Robinson B., Web-based standardized patient encounters for preclinical dental students during COVID-19 pandemic, J Dent Educ, 85, S1, pp. 1167-1169, (2020); Delgado-Castillo S.M., Miguel-Soto S., Atoche-Socola K.J., Arriola-Guillen L.E., Revolution in modern teaching in dentistry since the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic: a review, Dent Med Probl, 59, 1, pp. 137-141, (2022); Kakadia R., Chen E., Ohyama H., Implementing an online OSCE during the COVID-19 pandemic, J Dent Educ, 85, 1, pp. 1006-1008, (2020); Kerkstra R.L., Rustagi K.A., Grimshaw A.A., Minges K.E., Dental education practices during COVID-19: a scoping review, J Dent Educ, 86, 5, pp. 546-573, (2022); Burford B., Whittle V., Vance G.H., The relationship between medical student learning opportunities and preparedness for practice: a questionnaire study, BMC Med Educ, 14, (2014); Schonwetter D.J., Reynolds P.A., Eaton K.A., De Vries J., Online learning in dentistry: an overview of the future direction for dental education, J Oral Rehabil, 37, 12, pp. 927-940, (2010)","M.H.

Based on the theory of human-computer collaboration and the theory of production-oriented approach (POA), this paper constructs a university English POA teaching model based on human-computer collaboration. It also combines the speech recognition algorithm, S-T behavioural analysis method and social network analysis method to conduct a case study on the current situation of college English classroom teaching under this instructional design model. Meanwhile, a teaching experiment is designed to verify the effectiveness of the constructed POA teaching model. The results of the case study show that most of the university English courses favour the lecture mode, with less interaction between students, and the classroom is dominated by teacher lectures and teacher-student interactions, but at the same time, many teachers begin to experiment with the discussion mode, which increases teacher-student interactions and student-student interactions in the classroom. In addition, the experimental group adopts the POA teaching mode and the control group adopts the traditional lecture mode, and its independent samples t-test results show that the experimental group is significantly better than the homogeneous control group in the dimensions of interest, ability, attitude, and test scores in English literacy after the experiment (P<0.05), which suggests that the combination of AI technology and the production-oriented method can effectively improve the effectiveness of the design of university English literacy teaching and achieve better teaching effectiveness and has potential application value. © 2025 The Author(s)","production-oriented method of reading; S-T behavioural analysis; social network analysis; speech recognition; writing instruction","","","","","","","","Natasha P., An production-oriented approach to the impact of online written languaging on form-focused writing tasks, Journal of Language and Education, 9, 1, pp. 112-127, (2023); Liu G., Zhang G., Teaching reform of moral education based on the concept of production-oriented education, International Journal of Electrical Engineering & Education, 60, pp. 455-464, (2023); Larsen - Freeman D., Looking ahead: Future directions in, and future research into, second language acquisition, Foreign language annals, 51, 1, pp. 55-72, (2018); Zhang W., Tian H., Li Y., Study on College English Writing Based on Production-Oriented Approach, Journal of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences, 4, pp. 268-271, (2022); Wang X., THE ROLE AND APPLICATION OF PRODUCTION ORIENTED METHOD IN COLLEGE ENGLISH TEACHING UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF THINKING DISORDER, Psychiatria Danubina, 34, pp. 154-155, (2022); Li Z.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid transition to virtual education, impacting various educational sectors, including dental training. While online learning has provided a solution to maintain educational continuity, it has also raised concerns about its effectiveness in imparting practical skills essential for dental professionals. This study seeks to understand how dental students perceive their virtual education experience during this unprecedented time. Objective: The objective of the study is to assess student satisfaction and identify gaps in virtual education. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 112 dental students during the 2022-2023 academic year. Participants were selected based on their GPA and willingness to participate. Data were collected using Marsh's 21-question questionnaire, which was distributed electronically. The study adhered to ethical standards, ensuring informed consent from all participants. The minimum sample size was assured and established at 94 students. The descriptive analysis of mean and standard deviation were used for quantitative variables and frequency and percent for categorical variables. Independent t-test and the nonparametric tests of Manwitney-U and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA were used for quantitative variables, and chi-square and analysis of variance were used to compare and analyze the qualitative data. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS software version 25 (IBM, New York, NY, USA) with a significance level of 0.05. Results: The findings revealed a generally favorable perception of virtual education among students, with average scores in all dimensions exceeding acceptable levels. Notably, students in endodontics and oral diseases rated their professors higher than those in restorative dentistry and pediatric dentistry (p<0.05). The mean scores in the groups of endodontics and oral diseases were higher than in other groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Overall, students expressed a positive attitude toward the quality of virtual education, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing learning outcomes. Continuous improvement efforts are recommended to further enhance teaching quality and adapt to the evolving educational landscape. © 2025 The Author(s).

When compared to research papers, student-created podcasts rely on a less formal and more conversational language combined with hands-on use of technology, they have the potential to increase student engagement in disciplines like economics and finance. The process of simplifying and summarizing analysis, and explaining data in audio-only formats can help students understand concepts better. Further, student-created podcasts help students improve their communication skills, which are crucial for their placement on the job market. Using this hands-on approach, we have introduced podcast assignments in multiple courses. The novelty of our study is that we have introduced the student-created podcasts in upper-level economics and finance courses as an alternative to more traditional assignments while also including the assignments and details for other instructors to easily implement in their own courses. We conducted a survey to measure the impact of the podcasts on student engagement, learning outcomes, and job market preparedness. Having students research, write, and produce a podcast provides them with a tangible experience and a product that can be widely shared over social media and podcast platforms. Based on survey data collected we show that student-created podcasts are a successful educational tool that complements the existing traditional assignments, and students find creating the podcasts highly engaging and valuable. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Podcast; Student engagement; Teaching effectiveness","","","","","","","","Al-Bahrani A., Patel D., Sheridan B., Engaging students using social media: the students' perspective, Int.

Materials and Methods: We searched YouTube website to choose video clips that included information about robotic right hemicolectomy for right colon cancer. All videos were analyzed according to the criteria like quality of videos, quality of teaching, and modified Laparoscopic Surgery Video Educational Guidelines. Results: There were 16 complete mesocolic excision and 56 noncomplete mesocolic excision videos in the study. According to the Likert scale, calculated complete mesocolic excision scores were analyzed better than the noncomplete mesocolic excision group and this difference was statistically significant (P < .0001). The teaching quality scores of complete mesocolic excision videos were higher than noncomplete mesocolic excision group and this result was statistically significant (P = .02). The videos were scored according to the modified Laparoscopic Surgery Video Educational Guideline, and the score difference was statistically significant between complete mesocolic excision and noncomplete mesocolic excision videos (P < .001). The video power index was higher (mean 5.52 ± 15.56 vs. mean 1.66 ± 3.41) in the complete mesocolic excision group, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .086). Conclusions: Most of the robotic right hemicolectomy videos on the YouTube platform are insufficient in terms of educational capacities. Complete mesocolic excision-containing videos are slightly superior in this respect to noncomplete mesocolic excision videos, as considering a new technique can make video presenters more attentive. In our opinion, if the images presented to the video platforms are to be used for educational purposes, they must undergo a certain evaluation and screening process.

Although emerging studies have begun to explore log file data, there is a gap in the exploitation of log file data for capturing and understanding participants’ cognitive processes. The debate on how to maximize insights from log file data has not yet reached a consensus. Therefore, we present this protocol for a scoping review that aims to characterize the application of log file data in current publications, including the data pre-processing techniques, analytical methodologies, and theoretical frameworks used by researchers. This review will also aim to illuminate how log file data can enhance psychological and educational assessments. Our findings will highlight the opportunities and challenges presented by log file data as an emerging and essential source of evidence for future advancements in psychological and educational assessment. © 2024 Chen et al.

Game-based learning occurs when teachers use competitive, interactive, and entertaining activities to encourage students to engage in online learning. In addition, game-based learning impacts students' emotional and personal worlds and motivates them to study, with self-realization and knowledge progress in the English language as the ultimate goals. However, students have varying requirements and learning styles; thus, designing a universally applicable adaptive learning system might be difficult. Hence, this article suggests the Improved Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (IF-AHP) to effectively assess English teaching quality using Game-based learning in Colleges. The data are taken from the English language learner dataset for analyzing the teaching quality. Based on fuzzy variables, AHP, and entropy techniques, are suggested to deal with the difficulty of the instructor's teaching quality assessment problem. Firstly, this study builds hierarchy models and calculates the weight of assessment factors by AHP, then executes the hierarchical assessment and obtains the overall assessment outcomes by FCE. The online game-based learning system with the proposed IF-AHP model helps students to learn English speedily, and the system gets a good utility evaluation in system efficiency and satisfaction. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the suggested IF-AHP model increases the student engagement ratio of 98.5%, teacher knowledge level ratio of 97.9%, teacher performance ratio of 98.9%, accuracy ratio of 96.7%, and teacher involvement ratio of 95.5% compared to other existing approaches. © 2024 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net.","Analytical Hierarchy Process; English Teaching Quality Evaluation.

The application of the “hybrid” teaching model in online and offline college English teaching is the trend and the focus of local higher education reform. Nowadays, many universities at home and abroad have successively established online platforms and launched online courses, striving for seamless connection between online and offline classrooms. It can be seen that exploring the “blended” teaching mode of online and offline in local higher education institutions is a trend of the times and the current situation of English language classrooms in universities. The online and offline blended teaching effectiveness evaluation of college English courses is regarded as multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM). In this paper, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic numbers grey relational analysis (TFNN-GRA) method is designed for MADM based on the classical point GRA and triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs). Finally, a numerical example for online and offline blended teaching effectiveness evaluation of college English courses is given and some comparisons are done to show the advantages of TFNN-GRA method. © 2023 – IOS Press.

After analyzing the application scenarios of D2D, D2D technology is combined with social networks to create a teaching classroom where teachers and students can collaborate. A communication link is established in the network classroom to facilitate the sharing of art education content. Combine the network terminal caching system to improve the cache hit rate by caching multiple identical contents. Integrate network multimedia technology into art education and examine its contribution to education. The results show that the caching effect of multimedia technology is mainly reflected in four aspects: completeness, clarity, smoothness, and speed. When the number of caches reaches 12, the caching speed of the teaching content fluctuates in the range of 0.75-0.8. When the number of caches is less than 12, the caching fluency of the content is in the range of 0.85-0.9. This study provides a new direction to promote the reform of art education, which is conducive to improving the teaching effectiveness of art education and cultivating art talents.  © 2023 Jingjing Zhao et al., published by Sciendo.","Art education; Communication link; D2D technology; Network terminal cache; Social network","Arts computing; Engineering education; Multimedia systems; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Application scenario; Art educations; Art teachings; Colleges and universities; D2D technology; Multimedia technologies; Network terminal cache; Network terminals; Social network; Teaching effects; Students","","","","","","","Wang C., Zhang X., Liu L., The framework of simulation teaching system for sports dance based on virtual reality technology, Revista de la Facultad de Ingenieria, 32, 15, pp. 530-536, (2017); Halverson E.R., How the Arts Can Save Education: Transforming Teaching, Learning, and Instruction.

In this context, teachers’ perceptions of the predictors of online teaching largely determined the quality of its current implementation, but also the character of its further application in the future. Using the survey method, research was carried out with the aim of examining the attitudes of teachers in Serbia about personal predictors of online teaching and their determinants, in the past two school years. Personal predictors of online teaching are operationalized through the cognitive and affective competence of the teachers, as well as through organizational and technical support. Six hundred and seven teachers, who teach in the first three cycles of education, from all districts of the Republic of Serbia, participated in the research. Regarding all personal predictors considered, teachers evaluate cognitive competence as the most important predictor of the implementation of online teaching, then affective competence and finally, organizational and technical support. As the results of the research suggest, a significant influence of the dominant online experience, of the applied online platform, work experience and educational cycle on teachers’ perceptions of affective competence as a predictor of online teaching were determined, while the perceptions of organizational and technical support were significantly influenced by the place where the school was located and the applied online platforms.

Transversal knowledge, skills, and competencies are the foundational elements for developing the “hard” skills and competencies necessary for success in the labor market. In this paper, we introduce an online platform for assessing the attainment of transversal and soft skills. This tool allows us to define levels of competency acquisition and measure students’ development. The use of these competency levels helps improve the understanding of these skills and the evaluation process. The tool also enhances coordination among courses and teachers. The evaluation process can be established on three different levels: self-evaluation, peer evaluation, and teacher assessment.

However, the effectiveness of these platforms in improving teaching performance is limited. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of digital platforms in facilitating content delivery and pedagogical strategies, with a focus on their impact on performance in PCK (R-PCK), which offers a more objective measure compared to self-perception-based assessments. Specifically, the study investigates how digital tools influence R-PCK concerning variables such as gender, age, work experience, the origin of the training center, and general skills, including Reading Comprehension and Logical Reasoning. Methods: This research utilized data from the 2022 National Unique Test (PUN) for primary education teachers across all 24 regions of Peru, encompassing a sample size of 94,665 participants, with 67.4% females and 32.6% males. The study employed quantitative methods to analyze the data, focusing on the impact of digital platforms on R-PCK. Statistical analyses were conducted to explore the correlations between R-PCK and various independent variables, including gender, age, work experience, and general skills. The research questions guiding this study were: How do digital platforms impact R-PCK among primary education teachers? Are there significant differences in R-PCK based on gender, age, and work experience when digital platforms are integrated? What role do general skills play in enhancing R-PCK through digital platforms? Results: Preliminary findings indicate significant variations in R-PCK related to gender, the origin of the pedagogical training center, and work experience in both public and private sectors. The study identified negative and statistically significant correlations between R-PCK and age, indicating that younger teachers tend to have higher R-PCK scores. Additionally, there were positive correlations between R-PCK and general skills, suggesting that teachers with better reading comprehension and logical reasoning skills are more likely to perform better in R-PCK assessments. Conclusion: This study hypothesizes that digital platforms can effectively bridge gaps in R-PCK by providing targeted pedagogical support and fostering a more dynamic learning environment. The findings have significant implications for educational policy and practice, emphasizing the need for tailored digital interventions to optimize teaching effectiveness and student outcomes. © 2024, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

Therefore, a social network-based evaluation method for educational and teaching effectiveness in universities is proposed. First, we analyse the role of teaching effectiveness evaluation and design the principles for constructing a teaching effectiveness evaluation index system. Then, we calculate the entropy matching degree of evaluation indicators, set consistency criteria for evaluation indicators, and use SVM algorithm to classify evaluation indicators, constructing an evaluation indicator system. Finally, we construct a social network for teaching effectiveness evaluation, determine the subgroup cohesion of evaluation indicators, construct an education and teaching effectiveness evaluation function, and obtain the evaluation results. The experimental results show that the confidence level of the evaluation results of this method is high, and the matching error of the entropy value of the evaluation indicators is low.  © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","entropy matching degree; indicator system; social network; the effectiveness of higher education and teaching","Economic and social effects; Entropy; Effectiveness evaluation; Entropy matching; Entropy matching degree; Evaluation indicators; High educations; Indicators systems; Matching degree; Social network; Teaching effectiveness; The effectiveness of high education and teaching; Quality control","","","","","","","Cilliers J., Fleisch B., Kotze J., Mohohlwane M., Taylor S., The challenge of sustaining effective teaching: spillovers, fade-out, and the cost-effectiveness of teacher development programs, Economics of Education Review, 87, 2, pp. 1-10, (2022); Ding X., Salam Z.A., Lv W., Research on timeliness evaluation model of online teaching based on intelligent learning, International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Life-Long Learning, 31, 2, pp. 263-275, (2021); Du P., An English teaching ability evaluation model based on edge computing, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 36, 3, pp. 1-8, (2022); Fan P., Application of deep learning and cloud data platform in college teaching quality evaluation, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology, 41, 5, pp. 5770-5779, (2020); Gao B., Research and implementation of intelligent evaluation system of teaching quality in universities based on artificial intelligence neural network model, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 12, 5, pp. 1-10, (2022); Huang J., An internet of things evaluation algorithm for quality assessment of computer-based teaching, Mobile Information Systems, 13, 2, pp. 1-10, (2021); Ibrahim H., The satisfaction of students about how instructional design quality criteria for e-course in distance learning, International Journal of Educational Technology and Learning, 8, 2, pp. 70-82, (2020); Ji S., Tsai S.B., A study on the quality evaluation of English teaching based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of bat algorithm and big data analysis, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 65, 43, pp. 1-12, (2021); Li G., Liu F., Wang Y., Guo Y., Xiao L., Zhu L., A convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for the recognition and evaluation of classroom teaching behavior, Scientific Programming, 41, 9, pp. 1-8, (2021); Liu G., Zhuang H., Evaluation model of multimedia-aided teaching effect of physical education course based on random forest algorithm, Journal of Intelligent Systems, 31, 1, pp. 555-567, (2022); Luo R., Liao Q., Zheng J., Zhao L., A study on the evaluation method of foreign language classroom teaching process from the perspective of neuroeducation, International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 20, 7, pp. 2092-2104, (2021); Su Y., Chen G., Li M., Shi T., Fang D., Design and implementation of web multimedia teaching evaluation system based on artificial intelligence and jQuery, Mobile Information Systems, 23, 12, pp. 1-12, (2021); Wang H., Du Y., Tsai S.B., Evaluation of the effectiveness computer-assisted language teaching by big data analysis, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 15, 9, pp. 1-11, (2021); Wu G., Zheng J., Zhai J., Individualized learning evaluation model based on hybrid teaching, International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 7, 2, pp. 8393-8399, (2021); Yang Y., Quality evaluation method of a mathematics teaching model reform based on an improved genetic algorithm, Scientific Programming, 33, 6, pp. 639-649, (2021); Yu H., Online teaching quality evaluation based on emotion recognition and improved AprioriTid algorithm, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology, 14, 4, pp. 40-45, (2021); Yuan F., Nie Y., Online classroom teaching quality evaluation system based on facial feature recognition, Scientific Programming, 39, 14, pp. 1-10, (2021); Zhang J., Addae H.M., Bakeman M., Management students' perceptions of online teaching quality, e-Journal of Business Education and Scholarship of Teaching, 14, 2, pp. 33-52, (2020)","Q.

However, knowledge on whether adolescents’ perceptions of the quality of the teacher's instruction are also prone to peer influences is lacking. Method: This study (N = 248 German adolescents) used longitudinal social network analysis to investigate whether (a) friends become more similar in their teaching quality perceptions (influence effects) and/or whether (b) students with initially more similar perceptions of teaching quality were more likely to become friends (selection effects). We also explored whether (c) students with more positive teaching quality perceptions were better integrated socially. Results: We did not find support for influence or selection effects. However, students who rated their teacher's instruction more positively were better integrated socially. Conclusions: Our work adds to research on the role of peers in adolescence and enhances our understanding of peer influences on students’ perceptions of instruction. © 2024","Adolescence; Social network; Student ratings; Teacher support; Teaching quality","Adolescent; Female; Friends; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Peer Group; School Teachers; Social Perception; Students; Teaching; adolescence; adolescent; adult; article; child; controlled study; diagnosis; female; friend; human; knowledge; major clinical study; male; peer pressure; perception; social network; social network analysis; teacher; teaching; therapy; longitudinal study; peer group; perception; psychology; school teacher; student; teaching","","","","","Robert Bosch Stiftung, RBS; Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs Baden Württemberg; Baden-Württemberg Stiftung, BWS; Hertie foundation; Jacobs Foundation; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; European Association of Research; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (BA 7386/1-1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/S012486/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a grant from the German research foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, grant number: BA 7386/1\u20131) awarded to Lisa Bardach.

An online survey was designed to review what effect the pandemic had on the use and uptake of online educational sources amongst a representative cohort of maxillofacial surgery trainees in higher specialist training. Their attitudes and satisfaction with online resources were considered. The use of live sources such as webinars and pre-recorded materials (e.g. YouTube videos) was investigated. Engagement with online sources was considered prior to, and then during the pandemic. Alterations in the behaviour of trainees were demonstrated, with increasing online resource use seen once the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. Online pre-recorded resource use increased by 26% during the pandemic, with the median number of hours watched per month increasing from 1-5 h to 5–10 h (p < 0.001). Engagement with live online sources (webinars) increased by 52% and median time watched increased from 15 h per month to 10–20 h per month (p < 0.001). Trainees expressed satisfaction with the quality and flexibility of the resources. There was a firmly positive response to live webinars with regard to teaching quality, audio and video quality, ease of access and relevance to training needs. Pre-recorded and live online resources may prove a useful alternative or adjunct to face-to-face teaching when regulations limit or restrict social interactions. © 2024 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery","Coronavirus maxillofacial; COVID-19; Medical education; Surgery; Surgical training","COVID-19; Curriculum; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surgery, Oral; access to information; aptitude; Article; behavior; clinical practice; cost effectiveness analysis; e-learning; human; maxillofacial surgery; medical education; medical student; oral surgery; pandemic; questionnaire; satisfaction; social interaction; social media; specialist registrar; surgical training; teaching; videoconferencing; videorecording; webinar; coronavirus disease 2019; curriculum; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","","","","","","","Al-Jabir A., Kerwan A., Nicola M., Et al., Impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on surgical practice - Part 1, Int.

What happens to the network when the classroom expectations change? For example, there is a coursework expectation that students exchange contact information, or the instructor uses collaborative learning practices. Or what if the principal investigator (PI) of a scientific team goes on a sabbatical? This study uses the framework of classrooms because of their relatability across science. We asked how do different instructor coursework expectations change network structures within a classroom or other learning environments? A social network survey was administered at the start and end of the semester (pre- and post-test) in six university sociology classrooms to explore how expectations impacted the communication and learning networks. We found practical changes in course expectations impact the communication and learning networks, suggesting that instructors, facilitators, and others could be the archintorTM (architect +instructor+facilitator) of the network. Understanding that expectations can impact a network’s structure marks a paradigm shift in educational assessment approaches. If the archintorTM has identified the “optimal” network structure, then their task is to design expectations that result in specific interactions that ultimately improve student achievement and success. This work provides recommendations for classroom archintorsTM to create the most impactful classroom networks. Future research should extend beyond education and classroom networks and identify the best or desired networks in other areas like public policy, urban planning, and more. If these “optimal” networks were identified, an archintorTM could design a social network to solve wicked problems, manage a crisis, and create social change. © 2023 Love et al.

Using the rule grid and binary method, the tuple units in the structure of tuple automata are described and represented, followed by the standard combination of many tuples to form a tuple space. Considering that the definition of neighbors is relatively complex, von Neumann-type, Moore-type, and extended Moore-type represent the neighbors of a two-dimensional tuple automaton, and rules for the evolution of tuple automata are also formulated. Led by the constructivist teaching model, the contextual teaching method is divided into five links, on which the contextual teaching model based on metacellular automata is constructed. Simulation and Analysis are used to analyze the teaching reform of college courses in the era of artificial intelligence, for example. The results show that when the simulation condition is the initial satisfaction rate of the system = 0.425, and the teaching strategy n=2, the teaching quality improves with the increase of the response probability, which is in line with the law of teaching, i.e.The teacher should motivate the enthusiasm of learning, stimulate the interest of learning, and entirely play the role of students in teaching. This study aims to promote the reform of college course teaching in the era of artificial intelligence, which will contribute to the improvement of college teaching quality. © 2023 Zhuyu Wang, published by Sciendo.","Behavioral Simulation; Curriculum teaching reform; Digital platform; Evolutionary rules","Artificial intelligence; Automata theory; Curricula; E-learning; Simulation platform; Behavioural simulations; College course; Colleges and universities; Curriculum teaching reform; Curriculum teachings; Digital platforms; Evolutionary rules; Teaching model; Teaching quality; Teaching reforms; Teaching","","","","","Education Department of Hainan Province, (Hnjg2023ZD-63, 2022BC030)","This research is supported by 2023 Key Education Reform Project of Hainan Provincial Department of Education (Grant No. Hnjg2023ZD-63) and Fund Project: the innovation funds of Production, academic and research education in Chinese universities Beichuang Teaching Assistant Project (Phase III) (Grant No.2022BC030).","Yu Z., Visualizing artificial intelligence used in education over two decades, Journal of Information Technology Research, 13, 4, pp. 32-46, (2020); Yoon D.M., Kim K.J., Challenges and opportunities in game artificial intelligence education using angry birds, IEEE Access, 3, pp. 793-804, (2017); Chiang L.H., Braun B., Wang Z., Castillo I., Towards artificial intelligence at scale in the chemical industry, AIChE Journal, 6, (2022); Lu C., Lyu J., Zhang L., Gong A., Li X., Nuclear power plants with artificial intelligence in industry 4.0 era: top-level design and current applications—a systemic review, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 194315-194332, (2020); Intelligent manufacturing for the process industry driven by industrial artificial intelligence, Engineering, (2021); Cukurova M.C.R., Artificial intelligence and multimodal data in the service of human decision-making: a case study in debate tutoring, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, (2019); Jing X., Peng P., Huang Z., Analysis of multi-level capital market linkage driven by artificial intelligence and deep learning methods, Soft Computing, 24, 3, (2020); Yang H., Anbarasan M., Vadivel T., Knowledge-based recommender system using artificial intelligence for smart education, Journal of Interconnection Networks, (2022); Kharbat F.F., Alshawabkeh A., Woolsey M.L., Identifying gaps in using artificial intelligence to support students with intellectual disabilities from education and health perspectives, Aslib Journal of Information Management, (2020); Liu Y., Ren L., The Influence of artificial intelligence technology on teaching under the threshold of “internet+”: based on the application example of an english education platform, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, (2022); Huang S., Design and development of educational robot teaching resources using artificial intelligence technology, Pediatric obesity, 16, 5, (2021); Menekse M., Envisioning the future of learning and teaching engineering in the artificial intelligence era: opportunities and challenges, Journal of engineering education, (2023); Chiu T.K.F., Chai C.S., Sustainable curriculum planning for artificial intelligence education: a self-determination theory perspective, Sustainability, 12, (2020); Duan Y., Construction of first-class university course based on artificial intelligence and neural network algorithm, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 12, pp. 1-12, (2020); Li W., Role of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for teaching reform of linguistics, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 2, pp. 3251-3262, (2021); Ding Y., Performance analysis of public management teaching practice training based on artificial intelligence technology, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 5, pp. 1-14, (2020); Li B., Fei Y., Liu H., An artificial intelligence based model for evaluation of college students’ ability and characteristics through teaching evaluation, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 1, pp. 1-11, (2020); Huang D., Hoon-Yang J., Artificial intelligence combined with deep learning in film and television quality education for the youth, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics, 20, (2023); Nuez J.L.M., Lantada A.D., Artificial intelligence aided engineering education: state of the art, potentials and challenges, International Journal of Engineering Education, 36, 6, pp. 1740-1751, (2020); Chassignol M., Khoroshavin A., Klimova A., Bilyatdinova A., Artificial intelligence trends in education: a narrative overview, Procedia Computer Science, 136, pp. 16-24, (2018)","Z.

The results of this study can present a better understanding of work-based business learning and offers new insights for future studies. Design/methodology/approach: Recently the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated online learning. The pandemic’s pace and scale have led many universities and business schools to adopt popular e-learning tools such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or other online platforms. As a result, faculty and students needed new skills and resources in business education. Hence, the design and execution of online content were under scrutiny (Singh, 2022). After several months (almost two years) of operating in a highly virtual state during the COVID-19 crisis, there is little understanding of online learning in business education. In addition, asking about online teaching quality and student satisfaction is vital, as unsolved concerns may have long-term implications for future business programs (Szopiński and Bachnik, 2022). Therefore, this study aims to critically discuss the current literature to investigate the effects of online learning in business education during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results could present a better understanding of business learning and offers new insights for future research. Findings: The results from reviewing the selected articles showed several methodologies adopted in the field of business education. In this regard, universities must adopt an attendance policy for students with unreasonable excuses and those who cannot attend for technical issues. In this regard, facial recognition technologies and in-class tests that require attendance could assist. In addition, to encourage participation, business schools should build algorithms to measure student engagement and link it to the grading system. Finally, universities and business schools should have continuous assessment measures to ensure quality online learning matches higher education institutions in a specific country (Szopiński and Bachnik, 2022). Originality/value: Along with the benefits of online learning, business schools must be aware of the risks of extending their online courses. First, digital platforms must be introduced to support all online teaching and learning courses and allow information sharing. This demands institutional reforms and resources, which may be unavailable if a university lacks facilities, administrative support, or a training coordination program. The second challenge is the faculty’s attitude toward online learning and the IT support needed to provide an online environment. While distance learning must offer the same knowledge and skills as traditional learning, faculty should embrace technology as a teaching instrument. Therefore, perceived usefulness is a significant determinant of faculty approval of online education. A post-2020 pandemic study is needed to assess faculty opinions in future studies (Szopiński and Bachnik, 2022). © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business education; COVID-19; Online learning; Work-based learning","","","","","","","","Cunningham I., A new educational paradigm for the 21st century, Development and Learning in Organizations, 34, 2, pp. 5-7, (2020); Demetriou G., Papageorgiou G., Efstathiades A., Effects of learning style and learning source preferences on organizational learning capability, Development and Learning in Organizations, 36, 2, pp. 14-17, (2022); Pandit D., Agrawal S., Exploring challenges of online education in COVID times, FIIB Business Review, 11, 3, pp. 263-270, (2022); Singh S., Process improvement approach to transform online business education in the post-COVID world, Journal of Learning for Development, 9, 2, pp. 363-369, (2022); Szopinski T., Bachnik K., Student evaluation of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 174, (2022)","H.

In the genetic optimization stage, the adaptive variation probability is specifically utilized. When searching the global optimal solution, different variation probabilit ies are used in time according to obtained different fitness values, so as to reduce the population diversity and the number of global individuals. This can enhance the ability of the genetic algorithm to search the global optimal solution. The final evaluation index system is formed by modifying according to the reliability test and the suggestions made. Next, attribute simplification and calculation of index weights are carried out using rough set theory. And the BP neural network model is established wit h the assistance of historical data, which can be served as the main software constitution of an online platform. The attribute reduction by kernel and reduction calculation can greatly reduce the actual computation, which is beneficial for the relevant managers in universities to consider the diverse attributes and make corresponding adjustments for the decision-making scheme. © 2023, University of Agriculture.

This is especially true for research-intensive business schools aiming to secure recognition among top institutions globally. However, the emphasis on research has led to a realization: teaching quality must also be evaluated. Business schools must seamlessly integrate impactful research into teaching, creating a symbiotic relationship. This chapter explores the intersection of research and teaching, particularly in the context of graduate business-to-business marketing classes. It delves into the principles of co-creation of learning and service-dominant logic, emphasizing the active role of both instructors and students in value creation. The chapter highlights the importance of technology, including online platforms and the flipped classroom model, in facilitating interactive learning. It also addresses challenges such as large class sizes and diverse student backgrounds. Furthermore, the chapter underscores the significance of tailoring teaching to the unique needs of business-to-business marketing students. It suggests strategies like real-world applications, hands-on projects, simulations, and relevant takeaways. The ultimate goal is to empower students to apply their learning immediately, enhancing their value in the workplace. Effective teaching in business-to-business marketing is a multifaceted endeavor, driven by the interaction between instructors, students, and technology. As such, scholars need a flexible approach, recognizing that great teaching can take various forms depending on the audience and context, while emphasizing the need to bridge the gap between research excellence and impactful teaching. We end the chapter by addressing the challenges and strategies of translating research into teaching, emphasizing the importance of making academic research relevant to practical decision problems and the role of abductive reasoning in theorizing with practitioners. © Michel van der Borgh, Adam Lindgreen and Tobias Schäfers 2024.","B2B marketing;

The curriculum was divided into two segments. Initially, two groups were established for the first segment, covering an introduction to Biomolecular and Material Metabolism. The group A adopted a teaching strategy incorporating “massive open online course + a Social Media platform (WeChat) + Project/Problem-Based Learning + Flipped classroom”, integrating online and offline methods. The group B followed conventional teaching practices. In the second course segment, which included molecular biology and clinical biochemistry, the two groups had their instructional format switched. Comparative analysis of student satisfaction, learning attitudes, and academic performance between the groups was conducted. The satisfaction survey indicated that the group which adopted the online and offline mode outperformed the conventional teaching group in satisfaction rate, satisfaction scores, excellence rate, and total scores. While both groups exhibited an improvement in learning attitudes, the teaching reform group showed a significantly higher level of enhancement. Furthermore, the reform group achieved superior overall average scores, basic average scores, comprehensive average scores, and an increased rate of excellence compared to the conventional group. The results demonstrate that adopting a blended teaching model significantly improved instructional quality and positively influenced students' engagement and attitudes in biochemistry and molecular biology studies. © 2024 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.","biochemistry and molecular biology; online-and-offline teaching mode; teaching quality","Biochemistry; Curriculum; Education, Distance; Humans; Molecular Biology; Problem-Based Learning; Students, Medical; Teaching; biochemistry; curriculum; distance learning; education; human; medical student; molecular biology; problem based learning; procedures; teaching","","","","","Jiangsu Provincial Key Project of Educational Reform in China, (2021JSJG188); Jiangsu Provincial Higher Education Teaching Revolution Research Project in China, (2019JSJG509); Jiangsu Medical College, (Z202104)","This work was supported by Jiangsu Provincial Key Project of Educational Reform in China (No. 2021JSJG188); 2019 Jiangsu Provincial Higher Education Teaching Revolution Research Project in China (2019JSJG509); the construction project of high\u2010level professional group of higher vocational education in Jiangsu Province in China (Su Jianjiao Vocational Letter [2021] No. 1).

Based on this, the paper firstly designed a multimodal data-driven blended learning evaluation framework for higher vocational education, and relied on this framework to capture multimodal learning data of students participating in higher vocational education in a blended learning environment through automatic recording, online platform data collection, testing and other means; The results show that the combination of the variance selection method and the decision tree classification algorithm can achieve the best evaluation results. The chapter learning, video learning duration, topic discussion in online learning and attention and study notes in offline learning are the best evaluation features to evaluate students’ blended learning, among which the video learning duration has the greatest impact on the final test score. The article is important for improving the evaluation of personalized and blended learning in higher vocational education and reflecting the role of evaluation in improving the quality of higher vocational education. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Classification algorithms; Comprehensive assessment; Educational assessment reform; Higher vocational teaching; Learning assessment; Multimodal techniques","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Self-supervised learning; Blended learning; Classification algorithm; Comprehensive assessment; Educational assessment; Educational assessment reform; High vocational teaching; Higher vocational educations; Learning assessment; Multi-modal; Multi-modal techniques; Contrastive Learning","","","","","","","Akasaka Y., Onisawa T., Personalized Pedestrian Navigation System with Subjective Preference Based Route Selection, 2020 Joint 11th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (SCIS) and 20th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems (ISIS), pp. 258-288, (2020); Liu H., Research on Practice Evaluation System of Higher Vocational Preschool Education Based on Artificial Intelligence, 2021 13th International Conference on Measuring Technology and Mechatronics Automation (ICMTMA), pp. 1025-1046, (2021); Zhao H., Wang A., Fan Y., Research on the Identification and Evaluation of Aerobics Movements Based on Deep Learning, Scientific Programming, 2021, pp. 145-254, (2021); Luo J., Research on the Application of Data Mining in Teaching Based on Statistics, Proceedings of the 2018 2nd International Conference on Economic Development and Education Management (ICEDEM 2018), pp. 789-845, (2021); Jia W.Y., Evaluation of Practical Teaching Quality in Higher Vocational Colleges Based on Artificial Neural Network, Modern Computer, pp. 452-578, (2020); Zhao H., Amp L.V., Research on Personalized Group Division in the Project-Based Hierarchical Teaching in Animation Major, Software Engineering, pp. 1026-1125, (2021); Long J.Y., Research on High-Vocational Students’ Evaluation of Teaching Based on the Cluster A, 2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC), pp. 1356-1361, (2020); Easom K.C., Local Educational Assessment Program.

The technique, called Implicit Content Extraction (ICE), allows for the detection and analysis of (non-bona fide) presuppositions, thus enabling students to identify how much and what potentially manipulative information is being conveyed in a text. ICE has been tested on ready-to-use communicative materials. The materials were evaluated by EFL teachers (N = 10) who participated in a semi-structured interview. The analysis shows a positive reception of the materials, which meet the need for CDL, and a willingness on the part of teachers to implement the technique. Concerns are also raised about the explicit treatment of presuppositions, pointing to a low ability of students and teachers to analyse implicit strategies in a text. © The Author(s) 2024.","critical digital literacy; implicit content extraction; implicit language; pragmatics-oriented training; social media; teaching material evaluation","","","","","","Habilitationsforum Fachdidaktik und Unterrichtsforschung; Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz; Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Innsbruck","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The transcription of the interviews was supported by the Habilitationsforum Fachdidaktik und Unterrichtsforschung, Universität Graz, Austria; the Open Access publication was founded by Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Innsbruck, Austria.

Therefore, this article adopts an intelligent decision system based on big data analysis to optimize the teaching mode and resource allocation of entrepreneurship education in universities. In response to the problem of insufficient data acquisition and analysis capabilities in the current teaching process, the system utilizes computer technology to integrate multiple data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve comprehensive perception and deep analysis of educational data. Firstly, an entrepreneurship education data perception network is built, integrating multiple data sources such as students' learning behaviors, teaching content, and social media feedback. Secondly, deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks are used to extract learning feature signals at different scales. Then, based on methods such as decision tree algorithm, support vector machine, and random forest, a multimodal joint prediction model is established to achieve personalized learning path recommendation and educational effect prediction. In the dimension of ""system performance"", the proportions of 4 and 5 scores are relatively high, at 40.5% and 33.5% respectively, which further verifies the high evaluation of system performance by users. The studied intelligent decision system can significantly improve the teaching effectiveness and resource utilization of entrepreneurship education, effectively supporting education managers to make precise educational decisions and promoting the digital transformation and upgrading of entrepreneurship education in universities. © 2024 IEEE.","Big Data; Convolutional Neural Network; Entrepreneurship; Intelligent Decision System; Personalized Learning Path Recommendation","Convolutional neural networks; Federated learning; Intelligent systems; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Current fields; Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship education; Intelligent decision systems; Learning paths; Personalized learning; Personalized learning path recommendation; Systems performance; Teaching resources; Adversarial machine learning","","","","","","","Linpeng X., Junhao Y., The development trend, problems andconstruction path of innovation and entrepreneurship education in thesports industry of Chinese universities [J], Journal of Beijing SportUniversity, 46, 7, pp. 65-77, (2023); Wenjia W., Xin G., Research on the Impact of Innovation andEntrepreneurship Education in Universities on Students'Entrepreneurial Intentions: An Empirical Analysis from thePerspective of Student Participation in 11 Universities in SichuanProvince [J], Journal of Hubei Open University, 42, 4, pp. 45-52, (2022); Zelin Z., Zehai L., Yujia J., Comparative Study onInnovation and Entrepreneurship Education Systems in the ThreeMajor Regions of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, andGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area [J], Fudan Education Forum, 21, 1, pp. 71-78, (2023); Linli H., A Study on the Implementation Path and Implications ofInnovation and Entrepreneurship Education in Israeli Polytechnics [J], Journal of Southwest University of Science and Technology (Philosophy and Social Science Edition), 40, 2, pp. 97-104, (2023); Shekhar P., Handley J., Ruiz A.L., Et al., Women STEM faculty'sintentions to engage in entrepreneurship education programs [J], Higher Education, 87, 6, pp. 1865-1884, (2024); Yang L., Gao G., Research on innovation and entrepreneurshipeducation environment evaluation in universities under thebackground of ""Double Innovation"" with interval-valued intuitionisticfuzzy information [J], Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology, 45, 6, pp. 11189-11201, (2023); Takahashi K., Kiyosumi M., Verification of Sensemaking ProcessStarting from Self-awareness by the VIA Model in PBL inEntrepreneurship Education Program [J], International Journal ofAffective Engineering, 21, 2, pp. 77-84, (2022); Bell R., Bell H., Entrepreneurship education in the era of generativeartificial intelligence [J], Entrepreneurship Education, 6, 3, pp. 229-244, (2023); Cervantes-Munoz M.A., Devece C., Peris-Ortiz M., University-levelentrepreneurship education: A bibliometric review using Tree ofScience [J], Multidisciplinary journal for education social andtechnological sciences, 11, 1, pp. 1-19, (2024); He M., Zhang J., Evaluating the innovation and entrepreneurshipeducation in colleges using BP neural network [J], Soft Computing, 27, 19, pp. 14361-14377, (2023); Sherkat A., Chenari A., Assessing the effectiveness ofentrepreneurship education in the universities of Tehran provincebased on an entrepreneurial intention model [J], Studies in Higher Education, 47, 1, pp. 97-115, (2022); Aboobaker N., Human capital and entrepreneurial intentions: Doentrepreneurship education and training provided by universities addvalue [J], On the Horizon, 28, 2, pp. 73-83, (2020); Hardie B., Highfield C., Lee K., Entrepreneurship education today forstudents' unknown futures [J], Journal of Pedagogical Research, 4, 3, pp. 401-417, (2020)","Q.

Inculcated by an interplay of structured social and educational practices as well as strict government policies, the Sang culture is a deeply ingrained social expression that voices out resistance and non-conformity of the said youths. This study explores the proliferation of the Sang culture, outlines its implications, and navigates the ensuing challenges. Using the foundation of the Social Comparison Theory, the study found that the “downwards comparison” element dominated and were heavily applied by selected informants from the Generation Z cohort through semi-structured interviews that were conducted, but also saw positive “upwards comparison” in terms of togetherness in the social discourse. The influence of family expectations, along with stressful work environments fostered by rigorous academic expectations has also shaped the prevalence of the Sang culture. This study also found fostering open dialogues in families, diversifying academic evaluation systems, promoting work-life balance in corporations, and the efforts in nurturing mental health and active civic participation is fairly absent among youngsters form the Generation Z cohort in China. Further to this, ingrained social norms and rigid traditional structures resist these changes, thus rendering a strategic balance between social harmony and open discourse as necessary. The study underscores the necessity of initiating dialogues on the Sang culture, promoting Sang culture-centric research, and studying the effectiveness of social media in deconstructing the “Sang”. © SEARCH Journal 2023.","Chinese youth; generation z; Sang culture; social comparison; social media","","","","","","","","Abdelhak H., Romaissa C., Incorporating multiple intelligences theory in the learning and teaching operation: Teacher’s guide, British Journal of Teacher Education and Pedagogy, 1, 1, pp. 83-89, (2022); Akkermans J., Seibert S.

This article aims to identify the best algorithm to classify the satisfaction of university students applying the K-fold cross-validation technique, comparing the error rates of the performance metrics before and after its application. The method used began with the collection of student opinions on the teaching performance of the social network Twitter during an academic semester. Then, sentiment analysis was used for data processing, through which it was possible to categorize the opinions of the students into “satisfied” or “dissatisfied.” The results showed that the algorithm with the lowest error rate in its performance metric was the support vector machine (SVM). In addition, it was identified that its classification probability reached an accuracy of 91.76%. It is concluded that SVM classification using K-fold cross-validation will contribute to determining which factors associated with the teacher’s didactic strategies should be improved in each class session, since traditional surveying techniques have shortcomings. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the learning behavior data from 44 students specializing in computer-related subjects on the online platform of the 'Introduction to Computational Thinking' course, utilizing clustering algorithms. Subsequently, we utilized the Pearson correlation coefficient method to delve into the intricate relationship between diverse behavioral traits and academic performance. Our research has revealed that cluster analysis is adept at discerning behavioral disparities among students. Specifically, we identified four types of learning groups with different learning characteristics. Furthermore, a notable correlation was observed between homework scores and key evaluation metrics, including academic performance. Based on these findings, this study proposes targeted learning strategies and teaching suggestions, aiming to help educators better guide students in learning and improve the effectiveness of blended learning.  © 2024 IEEE.","blended learning; clustering analysis; correlation analysis; learning behavior analysis","Cluster analysis; Correlation methods; E-learning; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Teaching; Academic performance; Behavior analysis; Behavior-based; Blended learning; Clustering analysis; Correlation analysis; K-means clustering algorithms; Learning behavior; Learning behavior analyse; Learning models; Students","","","","","key projects of philosophy and social science research in colleges and universities in Anliui Province, (2022AH050160)","This work was supported by key projects of philosophy and social science research in colleges and universities in Anliui Province [Grant Number 2022AH050160].","Yao Y., A Dynamic Model for Blended Learning of University English Based On K-Means Clustering Algorithm, 2023 International Conference on Integrated Intelligence and Communication Systems (ICIICS), pp. 1-5, (2023); Qiao L., Jiang F., Cluster analysis of MOOC learners' groups: taking the 'STEM Curriculum Design and Case Analysis' MOOC as an example, Modern Educational Technology, 30, pp. 100-106, (2020); Saric-Grgic I., Grubisic A., Seric L., Robinson T., Student clustering based on learning behavior data in the intelligent tutoring system, International Journal of Distance Education Technologies, 18, pp. 73-89, (2020); Zong Y., Sun H., Zhang H., Zheng Q., Chen L., Logistic regression analysis of MOOCs learning behavior and learning outcomes, Distance education in China, pp. 14-22, (2016); Lan L., Shi R., Gou X., Research on Learning Partner Recommendation Method Based on Learning Behavior Model, Modern Educational Technology, 28, pp. 67-73, (2018); Hu H., Du S., Liang J., Kang Z., Construction of a Learning Performance Prediction Model: Based on Big Data Analysis of Learning Behavior, Distance education in China, pp. 8-20, (2021)","Y.

This algorithm factored in school attainment in each subject over the previous three years. Government officials initially stated that the algorithm was used to combat grade inflation. After public outcry, teacher assessment grades used instead. Views concerning who was to blame for this scandal were expressed on the social media website Twitter. While previous work used NLP-based opinion mining computational linguistic tools to analyse this discourse, shortcomings included accuracy issues, difficulties in interpretation and limited conclusions on who authors blamed. Thus, we chose to complement this research by analysing 18,239 tweets relating to the A Level algorithm using Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), underpinned by social actor representation. We examined how blame was attributed to different entities who were presented as social actors or having social agency. Through analysing transitivity in this discourse, we found the algorithm itself, the UK government and Ofqual were all implicated as potentially responsible as social actors through active agency, agency metaphor possession and instances of passive constructions. According to our results, students were found to have limited blame through the same analysis. We discuss how this builds upon existing research where the algorithm is implicated and how such a wide range of constructions obscure blame. Methodologically, we demonstrated that CL and CDA complement existing NLP-based computational linguistic tools in researching the 2020 A Level algorithm; however, there is further scope for how these approaches can be used in an iterative manner.

Based on the analysis of previous studies on teaching, this study aims to propose a formal model for the evaluation of teaching strategies in four dimensions: sustainability, usability, accessibility, and creativity. The use of information technologies to measure teaching strategies can bring decisive advantages. This work has been inspired by social rating systems of social networks to propose a measurement system in which a potential large number of evaluators with different levels assess the strategies. In addition, the proposal also includes the evaluation of the evaluators' own work, assigning confidence levels that are based on their experience but also on their evaluations. In this way, we have a social measurement system, in the sense that participation is open to a large number of evaluators. A large community of teacher evaluators will increase the objectivity of the measurement. The outcome of the system will be a characterization of the teaching strategies that will allow to decide in the future which ones should be adopted according to the needs of each one. © The Author(s) 2022.","Accessibility; Evaluation model; Multidimensional evaluation; Sustainability; Teaching strategy; Usability","Information use; Sustainable development; Accessibility; Evaluation models; Formal modeling; Four dimensions; Measurement system; Multi-dimensional evaluations; Social ratings; Teachers'; Teaching strategy; Usability; COVID-19","","","","","","","Guzman-Duque A., Las Crisis Una Oportunidad Para El Futuro De La educación Superior, (2021); Tang Y.M., Chen P.C., Law K.M.Y., Wu C.H., Lau Y., Guan J., He D., Ho G.T.S., Comparative analysis of student’s live online learning readiness during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the higher education sector, Comput.

Using the Student's Evaluation of Online Teaching Effectiveness (SEOTE) scale, a survey was conducted among 1042 students in different Indian universities. The scale measured student faculty contact (SFC), cooperation among students (CAS), active learning (AL), prompt feedback (PF), time on task (TT), high expectations (HE), and diverse talents and ways of learning (DTWL). The research instrument also included three open-ended questions. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Human Development Index (HDI). The Online Teaching Effectiveness Index (OTEI) value was moderate at 0.62. Challenging aspects of online education were found to be access, learning experience, technology, resources, and infrastructure, the need for face-to-face interaction, and the health hazards of long screen time. The survey of 60 faculty members recorded online teaching to be sustainable, backed by institute support, flexible, and creates the possibility of peer learning. Lack of training resources, unsuitability of course design and practical courses for online mode, and the need for an overhaul of pedagogy were the challenges. Policymakers and digital companies should include infrastructural changes and investments at both the institutional and digital platforms level. © 2023 The Authors.

It is an innovative and entertaining practice, which can reach millions of people through social networks and YouTube. For this reason, this specific was designed for students enrolled in the following three modules: The Spanish political system, public administration in Spain, and institutions and decision-making structures in both the of joint degrees in law and political science and in public management and economic sciences, as well as degrees in public management and degrees in political science. Educational audio-visual materials were co-designed and co-created to define a Municipal Council, its workings and its organization. This was a three phased experiment.. In the first, under the supervision of teachers, students developed five videos showing how Municipal Councils work. This allowed university students to become involved in a collaborative learning activity through which they acquired a series of important skills for future use, in addition to reinforcing their learning by participating in creation of digital teaching material, and also establishing a new teaching methodology consisting of learning-by-doing. In the second, professors and students attended CEIP Severo Ochoa Primary School in Madrid showing videos and playing two practical games, thus promoting knowledge transfer. In the third, the teachers evaluated the impact of this activity and the degree of satisfaction of university and primary school students. The result was positive, because not only was an educational innovation successfully implemented, but also a large part of objectives were achieved. © 2023 by authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas, CY.","audio-visuals; collaborative learning; educational videos; knowledge transfer; teaching materials","","","","","","Universidad Complutense de Madrid, UCM","Author contributions: GSM & GPA: elaborated the methodological part, the results, & conclusions & JCCL, OSS, JPH, MJGS, JFRF, & PMM: wrote the introduction & the theoretical framework.

Previous research has shown that female lecturers are viewed less favorably compared to male lecturers. Racial bias has also been observed in higher education. For example, few studies administered in the U.S. found that African American lecturers received lower ratings than White lecturers. Current research investigates whether biases based on instructors' gender (male, female) and race (White and South Asian) influence university students' perception of instructors in an online teaching environment in the UAE. Methods: Using a between group design, 318 participants viewed one of the four videos (male-South Asian, female-South Asian, male-White, female-White) of a virtual instructor teaching social psychology and then responded to teaching evaluation questions. Results: Factorial ANOVAs were administered. Biases showcased consistent preference for male and South Asian lecturers. Male lecturers were perceived to be treating students with more respect, speaking in a more appropriate manner, displaying more enthusiasm for the subject, and more approachable than female lecturers. South Asian lecturers were perceived to be more sensitive toward students' feelings, displaying more enthusiasm for the subject, and more approachable than White lecturers. Overall, students expressed wanting to study more from male and South Asian lecturers compared to female and White lecturers. Discussion: Biases emerged in interpersonal variables, such as approachability, sensitivity, enthusiasm for subject, and respect, and not in the domains of knowledge, presentation skills, and stimulating thinking. Findings reinforce that relying on teaching evaluations may not be accurate, and highlight how certain unconscious biases could impact professional growth of academics.

In the Flappy Bird game, the research model had the fastest growth rate and the highest increase in score, with a final score of over 120 and an average score of 63.1 for the game after the improvement of the activation function. When compared with the Double-Deep Q-network (D-DQN) model, the research model scored higher performance after training and the model curve performed better in convergence. The research model suffered less interference in noise amplitude and frequency, and performed better in adjusting the weights of the neural network. In the empirical analysis, the research model had excellent interference resistance and relatively smaller errors. The overall satisfaction score of students with the system reached over 90 points, effectively improving learning effectiveness as well as academic performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","DL; DQN model; Games; Online education","E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Social networking (online); DL; DQN model; Game; Game intelligences; On-line education; On-line games; Reinforcement learnings; Research models; Students' interests; Teaching and learning; Students","","","","","","","Yu H., Li X., An evaluation model of English teaching effectiveness based on online education[J], Int.

Assuming that students’ reported experiences can give valuable insight into the dynamics of the socially situated language classroom, this study explores students’ experiences of their English instruction. A Tripod survey was administered to three cohorts of lower secondary school students between 2015 and 2022 (N=316), and descriptive statistics were used to explore differences across classrooms, time points, and gender. The results showed that student experiences were, for the most part, in line with teacher instruction that predicts higher student achievement, engagement and motivation. Students reported to experience academic press and personal support from their English teachers to a considerable extent, while boys reported to experience curricular support more than girls. No significant differences were found across time or classrooms or between genders. Rather, considerable within-classroom variation highlights the individual student and the role of the English teacher in the socially situated practice of classroom instruction. A negative development in the reported intelligibility of the teacher’s spoken English from pre- to post-Covid-19 suggests the importance of the personal and academic communication between students and teachers when they are physically present together in the classroom. The study highlights the need to focus on the role of the English teacher in a society with a considerable presence of English. ©2025 Author(s).","Covid-19; English didactics; English language role model; Student experiences; teaching quality; Tripod","","","","","","","","Asp-Onsjo L., Ohrn E., To pass the test: The timing of boys’ parallel positioning, Education Inquiry, 6, 2, pp. 141-157, (2015); Ahmadian S., Brevik L.

Many institutes also use citation count as one of the factors in faculty performance appraisal and candidate selection of academic positions. Various strategies were recommended to amplify and accelerate research influence, particularly citation counts, by bringing research articles to a wider reach for potential readers. However, no prior empirical study was conducted to examine and valid effects of those strategies on nursing studies. This study examines and verifies the direct effects and mediation effects of some strategies, namely, the use of Twitter, international collaboration, the use of ResearchGate, and open access publishing, for amplifying the citation of research and review articles in nursing studies. Design: Cross-sectional study design. Methods: Articles published in top nursing journals in 2016 were identified in PUBMED and the citation metrics for individual articles until 2021 were extracted from Scopus. The primary outcome was the citation count of the article, while the tweet count on Twitter of the article was considered a mediator. The predictors included paper type, the total number of authors, the proportion of authors with a ResearchGate account in the article, funding support, open-accessed article, and the number of different countries stated in the authors' affiliation. A mediation analysis was conducted to examine the predictors' direct and indirect effects (i.e., via tweet count) on the citation count of the article. Results: A total of 2210 articles were included in this study, of which 223 (10.1%) were review articles. The median (IQR) number of Scopus citations, tweets, countries, and percentage of authors with ResearchGate accounts were 12 (6–21), 2 (0–6), 1 (1–1), and 75% (50%–100%) respectively. In the mediation analysis, tweet count, article type, number of countries, percentage of authors with a ResearchGate account, and journal impact factors in 2014 were positively associated with the Scopus citation count. The effects of article type, open access, and journals' impact factors in 2014 on Scopus citation count were mediated by the tweet count. Conclusion: This study provides empirical support for some strategies researchers may employ to amplify the citation count of their research articles. The methodology of our study can be extended to compare research influence between entities (e.g., across countries or institutes). Clinical Relevance: The citation refers to the research work cited by peers and is one of the indicators for research impact. Higher citations implied the research work is read and used by others, therefore, understanding the associated factors with higher citations is critical. © 2022 Sigma Theta Tau International.","bibliometric analysis; nursing research; research impact","Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Mediation Analysis; Open Access Publishing; Publishing; Social Networking; article; bibliometrics; cross-sectional study; empiricism; funding; human; journal impact factor; mediation analysis; Medline; nursing research; open access publishing; outcome assessment; Scopus; social media; social network; systematic review; publishing; social network","","","","","","","Aksnes D.W., Langfeldt L., Wouters P., Citations, citation indicators, and research quality: An overview of basic concepts and theories, SAGE Open, 9, (2019); Antoniou G.A., Antoniou S.A., Georgakarakos E.I., Sfyroeras G.S., Georgiadis G.S., Bibliometric analysis of factors predicting increased citations in the vascular and endovascular literature, Annals of Vascular Surgery, 29, 2, pp. 286-292, (2015); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 6, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Betz K., Knuf F., Duncker D., Giordano M., Dobrev D., Linz D., The impact of twitter promotion on future citation rates: The #TweetTheJournal study, International Journal of Cardiology.

These limitations hinder the implementation of optimal teaching strategies and have an impact on learning outcomes. Considering that the literature highlights the benefits of digital teaching, deeper investigation is necessary to enhance educators' digital competencies. This study explored the digital teaching strategies of Islamic education teachers in primary schools by focusing on improving pedagogical effectiveness in the digital era. This research employed a single case study design with a qualitative approach. Snowball sampling was used to select five primary school Islamic education teachers who were known for their proficiency in digital instruction. Data were comprehensively collected through in-depth interviews, observations, and analysis of audio-visual materials; rigorous measures were implemented to ensure the trustworthiness of the findings. The findings identified five main themes of digital teaching strategies that have the potential to enhance teaching effectiveness: i) game-based digital strategies; ii) web-based strategies; iii) metaverse-based strategies; iv) social media integration-based strategies; and v) interactive visual-based strategies. These findings have significant implications for educational practices, particularly in supporting pedagogical innovations that are relevant to current technological advancements. The study recommends providing more comprehensive professional training for teachers to strengthen their digital teaching competencies and their strategic leverage of technology in Islamic education teaching. © Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0.","approach; case study; digital teaching; Islamic educator; technique","","","","","","","","Abdullah F., Razak K.

Professional education has been pushed to modernize curricula and boost talent development efficiency. The vocational education curriculum system must take into account the usage of new technologies in a comprehensive manner to ensure the availability of knowledge and ability structure. To accomplish the goal, the application techniques and approaches of teaching and practice utilizing big data and digital media technologies in vocational education are explored and researched. To improve the teaching quality of higher vocational education, with the help of big data, this paper aims to conduct an in-depth study on the application of digital media technology in higher vocational education. Firstly, the teaching management system of higher vocational education is constructed. Secondly, the structure, efficient units, architecture, and database of the teaching management system are pronounced. Thirdly, fuzziness mining and teaching data scheduling are used to optimize and regulate the storage structure. According to the multiparameter optimization method, the teaching feature screening and resource scheduling are completed improving the capability of parameter recognition and online identification related to teaching resources. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper can make the teaching methods of higher vocational education more diverse. It is anticipated that it can help the reform process and growth of vocational education, as well as the development of innovative and entrepreneurial skills. As the data receiving rate of teaching resources is high, therefore, the ability of teaching resource scheduling is also strong along with a high application value. © 2022 Dongqin Wu.","","Apprentices; Curricula; Digital storage; E-learning; Engineering education; Scheduling; Digital media technologies; Higher vocational colleges; Higher vocational educations; Management systems; Professional education; Resource-scheduling; Teaching managements; Teaching resources; Technology for teachings; Vocational education; Big data","","","","","","","Li Y., Wang Z., Zhang L., Chu X., Xue D., Function module partition for complex products and systems based on weighted and directed complex networks, Journal of Mechanical Design, 139, 2, (2017); Shu D., Challenges and Countermeasures of Ideological and Political Education of College Students under"" New Normal, pp. 160-163; Quan Y., Development of computer aided classroom teaching system based on machine learning prediction and artificial intelligence KNN algorithm, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 39, 2, pp. 1879-1890, (2020); Ahmad H., Mamat N., Mustafa M.C., Yusoff S.I.M., Validating the teaching, learning, and assessment quality of Malaysian ECCE instrument, International Journal of Evaluation and Research in Education, 10, 1, pp. 135-141, (2021); Zhang S., Liu Q., Cai Z., Exploring primary school teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in online collaborative discourse: An epistemic network analysis, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 6, pp. 3437-3455, (2019); Wenjun L., Research on Digital Media Art Teaching Based on Virtual Reality Technology, pp. 320-323; Gong Y., Application of virtual reality teaching method and artificial intelligence technology in digital media art creation, Ecological Informatics, 63, (2021); Bender D.M., Vredevoogd J.D., Using online education technologies to support studio instruction, Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 9, 4, pp. 114-122, (2006); De Freitas S., Griffiths M., The convergence of gaming practices with other media forms: What potential for learning?

At the end of these new online course, the four students evaluated the comprising 16 teaching units. Methods: The seminars, each comprising four teaching units, took place in online blended-learning units and online events. After completing the seminar program, the four participants filled out a written questionnaire regarding the implementation of digital teaching, quality of teaching content, acceptance as well as advantages and disadvantages of the teaching format. Results: The acceptance of digital teaching was very high among stu-dents. Advantages and disadvantages of this teaching format compared to the previous face-to-face events became apparent; a positive assessment of the possibilities of the online format clearly prevailed, as com-petence-oriented, interactive aspects were very well implemented. Conclusion: Due to the need of switching to digital teachings formats, new, innovative perspectives have arisen for PJ teaching in Bochum as well as for the more distant second location Ostwestfalen-Lippe. This is particularly true with regard to centralised seminar offers despite decentralised training centres. When implementing “new” licensing regulations this creates an opportunity for general practice to include teaching practices in training throughout the country. © 2021 Streitlein-Böhme et al.","Digital teaching; Elective subject general practice; Internship; Seminar program","Digital Technology; Education, Distance; General Practice; Germany; Humans; Internship and Residency; Universities; education; general practice; Germany; human; medical education; procedures; university","","","","","","","Kuhn S, Frankenhauser S, Tolks D., Digitale Lehr-und Lernangebote in der medizinischen Ausbildung Schon am Ziel oder noch am Anfang?, Bundesgesundheitsbl Gesundheitsforsch Gesundheitsschutz, 61, 2, pp. 201-209, (2018); Synopse Approbationsordnung für Ärzte (ÄApprO) aktuelle Fassung-Arbeitsentwurf","I.

Many businesses and companies, such as social media sites and online services, used API to interoperate with other benefits. REST was considered the most logical, efficient, and widespread standard in the creation of APIs. Hence, the main focus of the study is to develop a Web-Based Student Information RESTful API. This paper utilized the incremental model in the development of the system. A survey was used to validate the problems encountered in acquiring student information and determine the software quality based on ISO 9126 software quality metrics. Survey questionnaires were distributed to the system developers as the study respondents following the total population sampling technique. A five-point Likert scale was used to quantify the survey result and weighted mean to analyze and interpret the result. Based on the analysis and interpretation, the system developers recognized that the system is Acceptable with an average weighted mean of 4.44. This study also developed a profiling system that is connected to the Single Sign-On (SSO) API. The profiling system serves as the data source of student information of the REST API. Besides, the portal and the REST API were utilized by various information systems such as ID Generation Management System (SIGS), Event Management System (EMS), Faculty Performance Evaluation System (FPES), and Smart Card-based attendance and monitoring.  © 2021 IEEE.","RESTFul API; Single Sign-on; Unified Student Information","Computer software selection and evaluation; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Smart cards; Surveys; Data Sharing; Management systems; Profiling systems; RESTFul API; Single sign on; Single signs-on; Social media; System developers; Unified student information; Weighted mean; Students","","","","","","","Wilde E., Putting Things to Rest, (2007); Li L., Chou W., Design and describe REST API without violating REST: A petri net based approach, 2011 Ieee International Conference on Web Services.

However, there are critical opinions that question the contribution of student interaction to real learning. This study applies learning analytics and data mining techniques to explore the online discussion forums of 362 business students at the bachelor and master levels, who participated in business simulation games between 2011 and 2016. The findings revealed that the most frequent contents in the students’ online discussion forums were related, firstly, to the parameters and features of the business simulation game, and, secondly, to elements that fostered the students’ learning process, while small talk or regular conversation did not appear to be relevant. In addition, the contents with predictive power over learning results were related to uncertainty, time, interaction, communication and collaboration, although none of these elements influenced teacher assessment of student learning. This study reveals the usefulness of learning analytics tools to gain a more wide and holistic view of the learning process of students, discovering new aspects that affect students’ learning results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Business simulation games; Data mining; Learning analytics; Learning outcomes; Online learning activities; Student interaction","Computer aided software engineering; Data mining; Learning systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Business simulation games; Learning analytics; Learning outcome; Online learning activities; Student interactions; article; conversation; data mining; human; human experiment; major clinical study; overlearning; simulation; student; teacher; uncertainty; E-learning","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (780262); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO","AP acknowledges the support of TEC2014-60337-R grants from the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (MINECO).

As a result, numerous instruments and strategies for obtaining student input and assessing faculty performance, as well as other facets of education, have been developed. There are two main methods to collect feedback from students, as follows: the direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, feedback is collected by distributing a questionnaire and taking their responses. The limitation of this method is that the true experience of students is not revealed, and there is room for bias in the collection and assessment of such a questionnaire. To overcome this limitation, the indirect method can be followed where social media posts can be used to collect feedback from students as they are active on social media and use it to express their opinions as posts. To address the problem of the manual annotation of large volumes of data, this paper proposes a machine learning method that uses the sentiment 140 dataset as the training set to automate the process of annotations of tweets. The same method can be used to label any qualitative data. In total, 5000 tweets were scraped and considered for this study. Various pre-processing methods, including byte-order-mark removal, hashtag removal, stop word removal, and tokenization, were applied to the data. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) trigrams technique was then used to process the cleaned data. The TF-IDF technique using trigrams captures negation for sentiment analysis. The vectorized data are then processed using various machine learning algorithms to classify the polarity of tweets. Performance parameters such as the F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision are compared. With a 94.16% F1-score, 94% precision, 94% recall, and 95.16% accuracy, the Ridge Classifier performed better than the others. © 2023 by the authors.

The present study investigated the experience of emergency remote learning (ERL) provided to higher-education learners. The study explores learners' perceived experience regarding the quality of learning resources, the effectiveness of teaching in a virtual climate and the scope of interaction in ERL. Design/methodology/approach: Utilising a snowball sampling method, data were obtained from 470 Indian students of higher education through a cross-sectional online survey using a questionnaire through social media platforms. Data were analysed with relevant statistics. Findings: The majority of students agreed that they had benefited from ERL. The overall impression of the ERL is positive; nevertheless, the students are perplexed and lack confidence in many aspects of the ERL. The Quality of ERL Resources, Teaching Effectiveness, Peer Interaction and Workloads were found to be significant factors in determining the quality of ERL. Originality/value: Learning from the crisis of a pandemic is paramount for the education system. The education system could not go back to what was considered normal before the pandemic; rather it is time to assess and finalise strategies from the experience during this pandemic that could be taken by the higher-education institutions to make the ecosystem better equipped to create 21st-century learning climate. Accommodating the components of remote learning-teaching and engaging technology towards hybridisation are the needs of the time. Hence, assessing the quality of ERL from the learner's perspective might contribute to redesigning future remote learning. © 2022, Mrinal Mukherjee and Chanchal Maity.","COVID-19 pandemic; Emergency remote learning;

This project applies a ‘floating classroom’ as part of a virtual Community of Practice (CoP) to enable tourism policy and planning educators to perform a benchmarking exercise for maintaining teaching quality despite geographical separation and social distancing mandates. Virtual CoPs can help maintain teaching quality at a time when universities are increasingly required to uphold international standards of excellence and as the coronavirus continues to make face-to-face interactions risky. The CoP enabled mutual support and knowledge sharing for the design of teaching approaches, materials, and authentic assessments. The paper was limited to three educators teaching similar courses in Anglophone institutions and reports the results of a one-off study. But findings will assist educators interested in maintaining or enhancing teaching quality over the course of the pandemic and post-COVID-19 futures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Communities of practice; Coronavirus pandemic; Cross-institution benchmarking; Quality assurance; Tourism and hospitality education","","","","","","","","Aaron L.S., Roche C.M., Intellectual property rights of faculty in the digital age - evolution or dissolution in 21<sup>st</sup> century academia?, Journal of Educational Technology Systems, 43, 3, pp. 320-341, (2015); Adedoyin O.B., Soykan E., Covid-19 pandemic and online learning: The challenges and opportunities, (2020); Airey D., Developments in understanding tourism policy, Tourism Review, 70, 4, pp. 246-258, (2015); Albrecht J.N., Authentic learning and Communities of Practice in tourism higher education, Journal of Teaching in Travel & Tourism, 12, 3, pp. 260-276, (2012); Baldwin-Evans K., Key steps to implementing a successful blended learning strategy, Industrial & Commercial Training, 38, 3, pp. 156-163, (2006); Bao W., COVID-19 and online teaching in higher education: A case study of peking university, Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies, 2, 2, pp. 113-115, (2020); Beerkens M., Evidence-based policy and higher education quality assurance: Progress, pitfalls and promise, European Journal of Higher Education, 8, 3, pp. 272-287, (2018); Bennett M.M., Barber L.B., Iaquinto B.L., The campus as Battleground: Placing the University Within the Hong Kong Protests, (2020); Bexley E., Government funding will be tied to uni performance from 2020: What does this mean, and what are the challenges?, (2019); Bhagat S., Kim D.J., Higher education amidst COVID-19: Challenges and silver lining, Information Systems Management, 37, 4, pp. 366-371, (2020); Blankenberger B., Williams A.M., COVID and the impact on higher education: The essential role of integrity and accountability, Administrative Theory and Praxis, 42, 3, pp. 404-423, (2020); Bloxham S., Hudson J., den Outer B., Price M., External peer review of assessment: An effective approach to verifying standards?, Higher Education Research and Development, 34, 6, pp. 1069-1082, (2015); Bloxham S., Hughes C., Adie L., What's the point of moderation?

In this exploratory study we sought to explore how do educational data, as generated by an online platform (i.e., Peergrade) and displayed in teacher’s and students’ Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD), can potentially inform us of the PA process and the peer interactions, as they take place. Participants in the study were 21 undergraduate teacher-students who attended a science course (electrical circuits topic) following the inquiry-based approach.

The development of technology has made these online platforms more and more powerful, escorting the continuous development of online education. Colleges and universities, as the main front for the cultivation of high-quality talents in my country, have already introduced large-scale online courses into education and teaching, enriching the teaching content, and expanding the teaching form. In the face of new technical means and abundant online education resources, the teaching quality of online classrooms in colleges and universities is so low, which deserves our further reflection. For a long time, the effect of online classroom teaching in colleges and universities has been closely concerned by the academic community, but most of them start from external factors, ignoring the internal relationship of online classrooms. Clarifying the complex relationships in the online classroom field of colleges and universities and clarifying the rules of habitus and capital operation in the online classroom field of colleges and universities are the intrinsic motivation and important source to stimulate the vitality of the online classroom field of colleges and universities and improve the quality of teaching. By grasping the essence of classroom teaching and analyzing the inherent characteristics of the online classroom field, this research intends to clarify the proper state of the online classroom field, and to explore the reasons why the current online classroom field function has not been fully realized, so as to find the depth of college education.  © 2022 Qianqian Zhao and Yan Li.","","E-learning; Classroom teaching; College education; Colleges and universities; Continuous development; Development mechanisms; Field theory; Full-swing; On-line education; Online classroom; Online platforms; Curricula","","","","","","","Bonk C.J., Kim K.J., Zeng T., Future directions of blended learning in higher education and workplace learning settings, pp. 3644-3649; Bourdeau D.T., Griffith K.V., Griffith J.C., Griffith J.C., An investigation of the relationshipbetween grades and learning mode in an English composition course, Journal ofUniversity Teaching & Learning Practice, 15, 2, (2018); Bourdieu P., Richardson J., The forms of capital, Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, pp. 69-72, (1986); Clark C., Strudler N., Grove K., Comparing asynchronous and synchronous video vs.TextBased discussions in an online teacher education course, Journal of AsynchronousLearning Net-work, 19, 3, pp. 84-96, (2015); Jonassen D.H., Learning to Solve Problems with Technology:AConstructivist Perspective, (2002); Faulconer E.K., Griffith J., Wood B., Acharyya S., Roberts D., A comparison of online, video synchronous, and traditional learning modes for an introductory undergraduate physics course, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 27, 5, pp. 404-411, (2018); Francescucci A., Foster M., The VIRI (virtual, interactive, real-time, instructor-led) classroom: the impact of blended synchronous online courses on student performance, engagement, and satisfaction, Canadian Journal of Higher Education, 43, 3, pp. 78-91, (2013); Francescucci A., Rohani L., Exclusively synchronous online (VIRI) learning: the impact on student performance and engagement outcomes, Journal of Marketing Education, 43, 3, pp. 78-91, (2018); Gedera D., SPStudents ' experiences of learning in a virtual classroom [J], International Journal of Education and Development Using Information and Communication Technology, 10, 4, pp. 93-101, (2014); Skylar A.A., Comparison of asynchronous online text-based lectures and SynchronousInteractive web conferencing lectures, Issues in Teacher Education, 18, 2, pp. 69-84, (2009); Spector J.M., Conceptualizing the emerging field of smart learning environments, Smart Learning Environments, 1, 1, pp. 2-10, (2014); Quigley C., Patrick J., Globalization's Contradictions; Geographies of Discipline,destruction and transformation, (2007); Pasco R.J., Capital and Opportunity: A Critical Ethnography of High School Students At-Risk, (2003); Norton D.W., The strategic technical communicator: a critical action inquiry of information architecture, Social Affairs, 24, 5, pp. 22-23, (2001); Weininger E.B., Lareau A., Translating Bourdieu into the American context: the question of social class and family-school relations, Poetics, 31, 5-6, pp. 375-402, (2003); Marinetto M., Who wants to be an active citizen?, Sociology, 37, 1, pp. 103-120, (2003); Forde C., Martin S., Galvin A.D., Children and young people's right to participate: national and local youth councils in Ireland, The International Journal of Children's Rights, 24, 1, pp. 135-154, (2016); Quigley C., Patrick J., Globalization's contradictions; Geographies of discipline, destruction and transformation, 97, 4, pp. 802-804, (2007); Gerissdoerfer M., Savaget P., Evans S., The Cambridge Business Model Innovation Process, Procedia Manufacturing, 8, pp. 262-269, (2017); Zhou P., Zhang Y., Analysis and Thinking on the Current Situation of Student Participation in Online Teaching Platforms, Journal of Nanjing Radio and Television University, 33, 2, pp. 40-43+81, (2010); Zhu Q., Lu F.L., The formation of media weakness and its rescue for vulnerable groups in the perspective ""concept, Social Sciences, 44, 6, (2005); Zhu Y., Han X., Yang J., Cheng J., Higher education with the help of online development has become an irreversible trend-a comprehensive analysis of the 11-year series of reports on online education in the United States and enlightenment, Tsinghua University Education Research, 35, 4, pp. 92-100, (2014)","Q.

This study investigates how two first year elementary school principals in the US state of Michigan become socialized to their new roles as school leaders by examining how these individuals make sense of new teacher evaluation policies and systems. Findings show these principals relied on their social networks to make sense of the teacher evaluation process. These principals did so in an effort to establish positive and trusting relationships with their colleagues and in an effort to make up for a lack of initial training with these systems. Implications for policy and practice are discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.","principals; qualitative methods; sensemaking; socialization; Teacher evaluations","","","","","","","","Bengtson E., Zepeda S.J., Parylo O., School systems’ practices of controlling socialization during principal succession: Looking through the lens of an organizational socialization theory, Educational Management Administration & Leadership, 41, 2, pp. 143-164, (2013); Chetty R., Friedman J.N., Rockoff J.E., Measuring the impacts of teachers II: Teacher value-added and student outcomes in adulthood, American Economic Review, 104, 9, pp. 2633-2679, (2014); Coburn C.E., Shaping teacher sensemaking: School leaders and the enactment of reading policy, Education Policy, 19, 3, pp. 476-509, (2005); Cottrell M., James C., Theorizing headteacher socialization from a role boundary perspective, Educational Management Administration & Leadership, 44, 1, pp. 6-19, (2016); Creswell J., Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design, (2013); Crow G.M., Complexity and the beginning principal in the United States: Perspectives on socialization, Journal of Educational Administration, 44, 4, pp. 310-325, (2006); Crow G.M., The professional and organizational socialization of new English headteachers in school reform contexts, Educational Management Administration & Leadership, 35, 1, pp. 51-71, (2007); Crow G.M., Glascock C., Socialization to a new conception of the principalship, Journal of Educational Administration, 33, 1, pp. 22-43, (1995); Ganon-Shilon S., Schechter C., Making sense of school leaders’ sense-making, Educational Management Administration & Leadership, 45, 4, pp. 682-698, (2016); Halverson R., Clifford M., Evaluation in the wild: A distributed cognitive perspective on teacher assessment, Educational Administration Quarterly, 42, 4, pp. 578-619, (2006); Halverson R., Kelley C., Kimball S., Implementing teacher evaluation systems: How principals make sense of complex artifacts to shape local instructional practice, Research and Theory in Educational Administration, pp. 153-188, (2004); Harris D.N., Ingle W.K., Rutledge S.A., How teacher evaluation methods matter for accountability: A comparative analysis of teacher effectiveness ratings by principals and teacher value-added measures, American Educational Research Journal, 51, 1, pp. 73-112, (2014); Kimball S.M., Milanowski A., Examining teacher evaluation validity and leadership decision making with a standards-based evaluation system, Education Administration Quarterly, 45, 1, pp. 34-70, (2009); Kraft M.A., Gilmour A., Can principals Promote teacher development as evaluators?

The ME tool was developed and deployed in outpatient clinic during preoperative teaching for patients undergoing surgical resection for lung cancer for quality improvement. Patients were given an electronic survey prior to preoperative teaching and at initial postoperative visit to assess teaching effectiveness and care satisfaction. Sequential patients received either standard preoperative teaching or teaching using the ME tool. Pre- and postoperative survey responses were compared using independent sample paired t test and multivariable linear regression modeling for adjustment. The final ME tool was an iPad application that incorporated real-time annotations of 3-dimensional, interactive anatomic diagrams. The tool featured video tours of operations, and radiology image import for annotation by the surgeon. Forty-eight patients were included in this pilot study (standard education n = 26; ME, n = 22). ME patients had significantly higher satisfaction scores compared to SE patients with respect to length of education materials, clarity of content, supportiveness of content and willingness to recommend materials to others. There was no difference in length of clinic visit between groups. Both patient and provider input can be used to create an innovative electronic preoperative educational tool that prepares and empowers patients in shared decision-making before surgery.

Digital media technology helps present information in transmitting knowledge or skills, reduces cognitive load, and promotes understanding of knowledge. Evaluation of the effectiveness of digital media teaching has also become important. A scientific and reasonable evaluation of digital media teaching effectiveness can help teachers select digital media technology and grasp the amount, degree, and timing of digital media use to change teaching effectiveness. This paper proposed using a combination of big data and artificial intelligence methods to evaluate the effectiveness of digital media teaching methods using the RBF neural network model. The digital media teaching effectiveness evaluation was used as the input variable of RBF, the degree of digital media effectiveness was the output variable and the neural network was trained through the collected sample data. The research results showed that the RBF neural network model proposed in this paper has a strong generalization and extension ability in evaluating digital media teaching effectiveness, providing a new way to evaluate digital media teaching effectiveness.  © 2022 RuiYao Zhang.","","Artificial Intelligence;

The research is based on investigation into WeChat groups comprising a sample of 90 university academic and administrative staff. I consider the reasons behind the additional workload of all staff, which is driven by the erosion of the boundaries between the public and private spheres on social media platforms. Participant observation of WeChat groups and interviews with academics and administrators reveal that the emphasis on collaboration on social media and chronic connectivity at work blurs the boundaries between work and private life. Underlying the increased workload and emotional engagement through WeChat groups is a faculty evaluation system that is shaped by market-driven key performance indicators (KPIs) and the centralization of university authority structures. The precarious work conditions that result has increased anxiety about work and private life in the academic community. However, the coercive working environment does not offer academic labourers much opportunity to resist. © The Author 2020","digital labour; social media ethnography; technology creep; university staff; WeChat group","","","","","","","","Allmer T, Academic labour, digital media and capitalism, Critical Sociology, 45, 3, pp. 1-17, (2017); Andrejevic M, The work of being watched: interactive media and the exploitation, Critical Studies in Media Communication, 19, 2, pp. 230-248, (2002); Andrejevic M, Estranged free labor, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 192-212, (2013); Benkler Y, The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, (2007); Boltanski L, Chiapello E, The New Spirit of Capitalism, (2003); Burawoy M, Manufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labour Process under Monopoly Capitalism, (1979); Burston J, Dyer-Witheford N, Hearn A, Digital labour: workers, authors, citizens, Ephemera: Theory & Politics in Organization, 10, 3-4, pp. 214-221, (2010); Cheung CM, Lee MK, Understanding the sustainability of a virtual community: model development and empirical test, Journal of Information Science, 35, 3, pp. 79-298, (2009); Clough PT, The Digital, labor, and measure beyond biopolitics, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 145-163, (2013); Crain MG, Poster W, Cherry M, Hochschild AR, Invisible Labor: Hidden Work in the Contemporary World, (2016); Crary J, 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep, (2013); Cubitt S, The political economy of cosmopolis, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 58-68, (2013); Fuchs C, Digital Labour and Karl Marx, (2014); Fuchs C, Fisher E, Reconsidering Value and Labour in the Digital Age, (2015); Gregg M, Work’s Intimacy, (2011); Gregg M, Presence bleed: performing professionalism online, Theorizing Cultural Work: Labour, Continuity and Change in the Creative Industries, pp. 122-134, (2013); Hardt M, Negri A, Labour of Dionysus, (1993); Hatton E, Mechanisms of invisibility: rethinking the concept of invisible work, Employment and Society, 31, 2, pp. 336-351, (2017); Hesmondhalgh D, User-generated content, free labour and the cultural industries, Ephemera, 10, 3, pp. 267-284, (2010); Hesmondhalgh D, Baker S, Creative Labour: Media Work in Three Cultural Industries, (2010); Jiang CL, Wang XP, Research on science popularization based on typical WeChat official accounts, Science and Technology Management Research, 40, 2, pp. 252-261, (2020); Jiang JG, Creating consent: casual like, inert consumption and dissolution of community culture, Nanjing Journal of Social Sciences, 31, 2, pp. 126-133, (2019); Khanna N, Johnson C, Passing as black: racial identity work among biracial Americans, Social Psychology Quarterly, 73, 4, pp. 380-397, (2010); Kosnik AD, Fandom as free labour, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 125-143, (2013); Lupton D, Digital Sociology, (2014); Neff G, Venture Labour: Work and Burden of Risk in Innovative Industries, (2012); Nobel DF, Digital diploma mills: the automation of higher education, Information, Communication & Society, 8, 2, pp. 217-233, (1998); O'Reilly T, What is Web 2.0: design patterns and business models for the next generation of software, (2005); Parsell MR, Floyd K, Making friends in cyberspace, Journal of Communication, 1, 1, pp. 80-97, (1996); Poritz J, Rees J, Education is Not an App: The Future of University Teaching in the Internet Age, (2017); Postill J, Pink S, Social media ethnography: the digital researcher in a messy web, Media International Australia, 145, 1, pp. 123-134, (2012); Ramey M, Technology creep vs. productivity - How much does tech creep cost you, (2018); Ross A, No-collar: The Humane Workplace and Its Hidden Costs, (2004); Ruyter A, Brown M, Burgess J, Big work and the fourth industrial revolution: conceptual and regulatory challenges, Journal of International Affairs, 72, 1, pp. 37-50, (2019); Silverstone R, The sociology of mediation and communication, The Sage Handbook of Sociology, pp. 188-207, (2005); Terranova T, Free labour: producing culture for the digital economy, Social Text, 18, 2, pp. 33-57, (2000); Turner F, From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Steward Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism, (2006); Zhou, Wang, The analysis of Christian Fuchs’s critical theory of Marxist digital labour, Journal of Xi’an Jiaotong University (Social Science), 40, 5, pp. 125-133, (2020)","","","International Association of Media Communication Research","","","","","","23571705","","","","English","Polit.

But there are also some problems: the teaching quality of online education is unsatisfactory; students' online learning effects are frustrating, and students' autonomous learning ability is poor. Based on analysis, teachers' literacy and Internet technology are important factors restricting the online teaching reform, and online teaching easily falls into the dilemma of ""shallow learning.""Digital twins can effectively realize the intelligent interconnection and interaction of the physical world and the information world, optimize the remote teaching process, and provide high-quality remote learning experience for learners. Based on this, the technology is used to the teaching of space geometry to help students understand it and improve their performance. First, the principle and advantages of digital twins are expounded. Second, the platform system based on digital twins is constructed. Then, the corresponding digital model is drawn by using the drawing function of MATLAB software, and the system based on virtual reality (VR) is established. Finally, the students of four classes of the same major are selected as the research subjects to test the teaching effect of advanced mathematics on the digital platform. The results show that students' scores in the traditional classrooms are form 2.5 to 5.5 and their average score is 4.049, while the scores of the students in the digital twin classrooms are between 5.5 and 9.5 and their average score goes up to 7.986. This shows that students' performance in the digital twin classrooms is 97.2%, higher than that in the traditional classrooms. A fully digitized spatial geometric model is implemented by using digital twins, and it can help students understand the mathematical theory of spatial analytic geometry, and their learning effect is greatly improved. This study provides a new direction for the application of new technologies in mathematics teaching.  © 2021 Kaiqi Wang.","","","","","","","","","Lee J., Integration of digital twin and deep learning in cyber-physical systems: Towards, Smart Manufacturing, 38, 8, pp. 901-910, (2020);

The teaching resource database is an open and highly interactive teaching service system that is based on information, based on the content of professional courses, with the help of computer science and technology, established on a network platform, and adapted to the development of the network. Providing diversified teaching resources is an important measure for schools to improve teaching quality. This article aims to study how to use information technology to build a digital media art teaching resource library. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of digital media art and the collection channels of digital media art teaching resources, a digital media art teaching resource library is designed, the administrator module, user module, and resource library framework are described, and some functions are tested. The test results show that no bugs are found in the function test, and the performance meets the current user volume and selection requirements. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Digital media art; Information technology; Resource search; Teaching resource database","Arts computing; Curricula; Database systems; Digital libraries; E-learning; Engineering education; Information use; Application of information technologies; Art teachings; Education systems; Modern information technologies; Resource database; Resource libraries; Resource search; System reform; Teaching resource database; Teaching resources; Digital storage","","","","","","","Li J., Yao L.J., Opportunities and challenges of digital media art in the era of big data, J Phys Conf Ser, 1856, 1, (2021); Expressive remix therapy: Using digital media art in therapeutic group sessions with children and adolescents, Jamerson J, 24, 1, pp. 159-165, (2018); Lv T., You X., Zhang J., Design and implementation of teaching resource platform for higher vocational insitute, Int J Soc Sci Educ Res, 2, 8, pp. 1-5, (2019); Theis T.N., Wong H., The end of Moore’s law: A new beginning for information technology, Comput Sci Eng, 19, 2, pp. 41-50, (2017); Sambamurthy V.S., Et al., The design of information technology planning systems for varying organizational contexts, Euro J Inf Syst, 2, 1, pp. 23-35, (2017); Baysari M.T., Lehnbom E.C., Li L., Et al., The effectiveness of information technology to improve antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Int J Med Inform, 92, Aug., pp. 15-34, (2016); Afshin A., Babalola D., McLean M., Et al., Information technology and lifestyle: A systematic evaluation of internet and mobile interventions for improving diet, physical activity, obesity, tobacco, and alcohol use, J am Heart Assoc, 5, 9, pp. 2016-2108, (2016); Bae S.J., Suh B., The impact of organization member’s self-congruity on the performance of the acquisition of new information technology, J Inf Technol Appl Manage, 23, 2, pp. 29-59, (2016); Mocetti S., Pagnini M., Sette E., Information technology and banking organization, J Financ Serv Res, 51, 3, pp. 313-338, (2017); Jorgenson D.W., Ho M.S., Samuels J.D., The impact of information technology on postwar US economic growth, Telecommun Policy, 40, 5, pp. 398-411, (2016); Melian-Gonzalez S., Bulchand-Gidumal J., A model that connects information technology and hotel performance, Tourism Manage, 53, pp. 30-37, (2016)","H.

While previous studies have demonstrated the utility of Facebook for enhancing student engagement, little is known about whether there are different profiles of students with different engagement patterns in the Facebook learning environment. Adopting a person-centred approach, we aim to fill this gap in the current study by identifying unobserved sub-populations of students with respect to their engagement patterns in the Facebook as a supplemental learning platform. Latent profile analysis revealed three engagement profiles, a minimally engaged, a moderately engaged, and a highly engaged profile. Results also suggested that academic disciplines and teacher involvement in the Facebook learning activities were significant predictors of student membership in the three engagement profiles. Our findings offer implications for the design and delivery of Facebook learning activities that cater to different groups of learners with different learning needs. © The Author(s) 2021.","Facebook learning platform; latent profile analysis; profile membership; student engagement","","","","","","","","Appleton J.J., Christenson S.L., Furlong M.J., Student engagement with school: Critical conceptual and methodological issues of the construct, Psychology in the Schools, 45, 5, pp. 369-386, (2008); Appleton J.J., Christenson S.L., Kim D., Reschly A.L., Measuring cognitive and psychological engagement: Validation of the student engagement instrument, Journal of School Psychology, 44, 5, pp. 427-445, (2006); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Exploratory structural equation modeling, Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 16, 3, pp. 397-438, (2009); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Auxiliary variables in mixture modeling: Three-step approaches using M plus, Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 21, 3, pp. 329-341, (2014); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Morin A.J., Bayesian structural equation modeling with cross-loadings and residual covariances: Comments on Stromeyer et al, Journal of Management, 41, 6, pp. 1561-1577, (2015); Awidi I.T., Paynter M., Vujosevic T., Facebook group in the learning design of a higher education course: An analysis of factors influencing positive learning experience for students, Computers & Education, 129, pp. 106-121, (2019); Bae C.L., DeBusk-Lane M., Middle school engagement profiles: Implications for motivation and achievement in science, Learning and Individual Differences, 74, (2019); Bae C.L., DeBusk-Lane M.L., Lester A.M., Engagement profiles of elementary students in urban schools, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 62, (2020); Ben-Eliyahu A., Moore D., Dorph R., Schunn C.D., Investigating the multidimensionality of engagement: Affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement across science activities and contexts, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 53, pp. 87-105, (2018); Bergdahl N., Nouri J., Fors U., Knutsson O., Engagement, disengagement and performance when learning with technologies in upper secondary school, Computers & Education, 149, (2020); Bergman L.R., Andersson H., The person and the variable in developmental psychology, Zeitschrift Für Psychologie / Journal of Psychology, 218, 3, pp. 155-165, (2010); Blumenfeld P., Modell J., Bartko W.T., Secada W.G., Fredricks J.A., Friedel J., Paris A., School engagement of inner-city students during middle childhood, Developmental pathways through Middle childhood: Rethinking contexts and diversity as resources, pp. 145-170, (2005); Bowman N.D., Akcaoglu M., I see smart people!”: Using Facebook to supplement cognitive and affective learning in the university mass lecture, The Internet and Higher Education, 23, pp. 1-8, (2014); Collins L.M., Lanza S.T., Latent class and latent transition analysis: With applications in the social, behavioral, and health sciences, (2009); Connell J.P., Context, self, and action: A motivational analysis of self-system processes across the life span, The Self in Transition: Infancy to Childhood, 8, pp. 61-97, (1990); Connell J., Welborn J., Competence, autonomy and relatedness: A motivational analysis of self-system processes, Self processes in development: Minnesota symposium on child psychology, pp. 43-40, (1991); Cunha F.R.D., van Kruistum C., van Oers B., Teachers and Facebook: Using online groups to improve students’ communication and engagement in education, Communication Teacher, 30, 4, pp. 228-241, (2016); Datu J.A.D., Yang W., Valdez J.P.M., Chu S.K.W., Is Facebook involvement associated with academic engagement among Filipino university students?

The DVCD teaching quality can be improved to a new level by providing feedbacks to applications with the data on students’ needs for practical perception (PPN). However, the current practical perception and service applications rarely tackle the feature extraction and application of highlevel needs for practical perception in the context of digital media. To solve the problem, this paper explores the practical perception and quality evaluation for DVCD teaching in the context of digital media. Specifically, the students’ PPN feature extraction problem was described in the field of DVCD teaching, and fuzzy clustering was introduced to extract students’ PPN features. Then, the authors detailed the dynamic evolution of students’ PPN in the context of digital media, and selected multiple layers of evaluation indices for DVCD teaching quality. Finally, the evolution drivers and patterns of students’ PPN were demonstrated, and the distribution of teaching quality scores was obtained through experiments. © 2022, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of social distancing and online teaching related to COVID-19 on the quality of life and anxiety of Brazilian dental professors. This was a cross-sectional study conducted from August 2020 to October 2020. Three instruments were used in an online version: a questionnaire about personal data, academic information and online teaching activities, the Generalized Anxiety Disorders 7 (GAD7) scale, and the Abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref) scale. All instruments were sent by e-mail, social media, and messaging apps to private and public universities and professors. Of the 318 responses, 187 (58.8%) were from female professors. Moreover, lack of good internet access and adequate place for online teaching, difficulties in producing teaching materials, and housework roles had a significant impact on the quality of life and anxiety scores (all p-values < 0.05). Also, Brazilian dental professors who declared that they would make greater efforts if the activities were face-to-face had significantly worse quality of life and anxiety scores, and female professors had significantly higher anxiety scores (all p-values < 0.05). These results provide evidence of a negative effect of social distancing and online teaching activities related to COVID-19 outbreak on the health-related quality of life and mental health of Brazilian dental professors. © 2022.

In order to answer the existing trends, the authors of the paper present the interdisciplinary joint work of the employees at their university to meet the needs of IT students and equip them to successfully enter the job market prior and/or upon their graduation. The paper presents an integrated experience of domain content and English language courses with the purpose to help students create a professional showcase via a visume (video resume), e-portfolio and LinkedIn account. The paper demonstrates the methodology developed and integrated into the curriculum of Computing and Informatics study programme at our university to scaffold students create and develop their e-portfolio on all three levels of studies: Bachelor, Master and Doctoral. The provided methodology helps students to demonstrate and organise the practical use of their academic knowledge acquired over the years. The e-portfolio data are further accompanied and linked to the visume and LinkedIn account. In order to evaluate the impact of the implementations made in our study programme, an online survey among 182 graduate IT students, who are part of University LinkedIn network, was conducted during December 2018. The results show that the collective experience is an excellent manner for future graduates to articulate their skills, abilities and achievements to their potential employers by placing them in a publicly accessible online space while at the same time the university displays higher teaching quality and gains better reputation. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.","Digital literacies;

Procedure-based assessments (PBAs) and direct observation of practical skills (DOPS) are integrated within the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme online platform and aim to assess trainees’ performance in practical surgical skills; no reviews have previously investigated their educational usefulness in postgraduate surgical training. Usefulness was defined by the 5 criteria detailed by Van der Vleuten for determining the usefulness of educational assessment tools: validity; reliability; acceptability to learners and faculty; impact on future learning and practice; and costs (to the individual trainee, the institution, and society at large). Methods: Scoping review methodology was used to examine the educational usefulness of PBA and DOPS assessments in postgraduate surgical training. A literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was undertaken. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses standards for systematic reviews were followed. Results/Discussion: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, with 1368 trainees and trainers included. A variety of study methodologies were identified. Although there is some evidence for the validity and reliability of both PBA and DOPS assessments, further work is required in both these domains including on the number of assessments required to ensure satisfactory reliability. This is a research priority, especially if these assessments become a component of summative assessment of trainee competency. The literature indicates that these assessments are generally acceptable to learners and faculty but their acceptability is negatively impacted upon by uncertainty over whether these assessments constitute a formative or summative assessment of trainees. With regards to costs, correct use of PBAs does require allocated time and resources to ensure their correct use and this must be factored into trainer and trainee job plans. Conclusions: PBA and DOPS assessments are educationally useful tools in postgraduate surgical training. Further research is required to determine the number of assessments required to ensure adequate reliability. To ensure the educational benefits of these assessments are not diminished, clarification from postgraduate training schemes is required regarding whether these assessments an assessment for learning or an assessment of learning. © 2020 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","direct observation of practical skills; procedure-based assessment; scoping review; surgical education","Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Educational Measurement; Ireland; Reproducibility of Results; United Kingdom; article; curriculum; Embase; human; learning; Medline; postgraduate education; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; reliability; research priority; skill; surgical training; systematic review; uncertainty; validity; Web of Science; clinical competence; curriculum; education; Ireland; reproducibility; United Kingdom","","","","","","","Van Der Vleuten C.P.M., The assessment of professional competence: Developments, research and practical implications, Adv Heal Sci Educ, 1, pp. 41-67, (1996); Colquhoun H.L., Levac D., O'Brien K.K., Et al., Scoping reviews: time for clarity in definition, methods, and reporting, J Clin Epidemiol [Internet], 67, pp. 1291-1294, (2014); Ali A.S., Bussey M., O'Flynn K.J., Eardley I., Quality of feedback using workplace based assessments in urological training, Br J Med Surg Urol [Internet], 5, pp. 39-43, (2012); Marriott J., Purdie H., Crossley J., Beard J.D., Evaluation of procedure-based assessment for assessing trainees’ skills in the operating theatre, Br J Surg [Internet], 98, pp. 450-457, (2011); Awad Z., Hayden L., Muthuswamy K., Ziprin P., Darzi A., Tolley N.S., Does direct observation of procedural skills reflect trainee's progress in otolaryngology?, Clin Otolaryngol, 39, pp. 169-173, (2014); Shalhoub J., Marshall D.C., Ippolito K., Perspectives on procedure-based assessments: a thematic analysis of semistructured interviews with 10 UK surgical trainees, BMJ Open [Internet], 24, (2017); Parry-Smith W., Mahmud A., Landau A., Hayes K., Workplace-based assessment: a new approach to existing tools, Obstet Gynaecol [Internet], 16, pp. 281-285, (2014); Hunter A.R., Baird E.J., Reed M.R., Procedure-based assessments in trauma and orthopaedic training-The trainees’ perspective, Med Teach, 37, pp. 444-449, (2015); Phillips A.W., Madhaven A., Bookless L.R., McAfee D.A.L., Surgical trainers’ experience and perspectives on workplace-based assessments, J Surg Educ [Internet], 72, pp. 979-984, (2015); Satpathy A., Kneebone R., Workplace-based assessment insurgical training: a qualitative study, Bull R Coll Surg Engl [Internet], 93, pp. 1-5, (2011); Gaunt A., Patel A., Royle J., Et al., What do surgeons and trainees think of WBAs and how do they use them?, Bull R Coll Surg Engl [Internet], 98, pp. 408-414, (2016); Roushdi I., Tennent D., Current usage patterns of procedure-based assessments in the orthopaedic community, Bull R Coll Surg Engl [Internet], 97, pp. e1-e3, (2015); Hunter A.R., Baird E.J., Reed M.R., Procedure-based assessments in trauma and orthopaedic training–the trainees’ perspective, Med Teach [Internet], 37, pp. 444-449, (2015); James K., Cross K., Lucarotti M.E., Fowler A.L., Cook T.A., Undertaking procedure-based assessment is feasible in clinical practice, Ann R Coll Surg Engl, 91, pp. 110-112, (2009)","A.

However, there remains insufficient evidence that peer assessment conditions are beneficial for teacher education. In this article, empirical research literature on peer assessment of pre-service teaching performance are reviewed. The articles were from the ERIC and Scopus databases, from 2002 to 2020. Only fifteen studies met the selection criteria described herein. The studies differed in the type of assessment used but converged toward the conclusion that incorporating peer assessment into different stages of teacher education was appropriate and worthwhile. We discuss the theoretical perspectives on why peer assessment might work in teacher education, pointing out practical implications for decision-makers in this field. Finally, recommendations and constraints for researching and implementing peer assessment are discussed from the perspective of innovation within pre-service teacher education. © 2020, Association for the Development of Science, Engineering and Education.

The interpretation of opinions gathered from similar studies provides us with many instances of technology adoption practices which is deemed necessary to overcome the challenges faced by institutions. To provide justification to the merits of learning technologies, it is critical to inspect significant elements which will be helpful in giving an appropriate framework model from within and outside learning institutions. An exploratory study is conducted here on existing work on the provisions and usage of computer learning tools in various higher education institutions (HEI) in Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to explore the framework model as a way to assist teachers improve teaching performance using computing tools so as to support progressive learning in institutions. The study findings could firstly provide pragmatic data on the technology innovations usages in HEI from a Malaysian perspective. Secondly, the study outcome may perhaps guide the HEI authority to establish practical boundaries on current and emerging ICT implementations. Thirdly, this may assist in developing strategies in line with the National Educational Policy on the use of technology-assisted learning for twenty-first century higher education. The study concludes that the use of digital technology tools can be considered as a resourceful alternative to conventional learning and teaching providing suitable recommendations for learning orientation and extend opportunities for future empirical research. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Digital learning technologies; eLearning; Higher education; Learning objects; Social media","","","","","","","","Adzharuddin N.A., Ling L.H., Learning management system (LMS) among university students: Does it work, Int J E-Educ, E-Bus, E-Manag E-Learn, 3, 3, pp. 248-252, (2013); Al-Rahmi W., Othman M., Yusuf L., The role of social media for collaborative learning to improve academic performance of students and researchers in Malaysian higher education, Int Rev Res Open Distrib Learn, 16, 4, (2015); Buzzetto-More N., Student perceptions of various eLearning components, Interdiscip J Elearning Learn Objects, 4, 1, pp. 113-135, (2008); Chan F.M., ICT in Malaysian Schools: Policy and Strategies. in a Workshop on the Promotion of ICT in Education to Narrow the Digital Divide, pp. 15-22, (2002); Hafiz Zakaria M., Watson J., Edwards S.L., Investigating the use of Web 2.0 technology by Malaysian students, Multicult Educ & Technol J, 4, 1, pp. 17-29, (2010); Hamat A., Embi M.A., Hassan H.A., The use of social networking sites among Malaysian university students, Int Educ Stud, 5, 3, pp. 56-66, (2012); Hamid S., Waycott J., Kurnia S., Chang S., Understanding students’ perceptions of the benefits of online social networking use for teaching and learning, Internet High Educ, 26, pp. 1-9, (2015); Hong K.S., Songan P., ICT in the changing landscape of higher education in Southeast Asia, Australas J Educ Technol, 27, 8, (2011); Hoque K.E., Razak A.Z.A., Zohora M.F., ICT utilization among school teachers and principals in Malaysia, Int J Acad Res Progive Educ Dev, 1, 4, pp. 17-34, (2012); Hsbollah H.M., Idris K.M., ELearning adoption: The role of relative advantages, trialability and academic specialisation, Campus-Wide Inf Syst, 26, 1, pp. 54-70, (2009); Hussin S., Manap M.R., Amir Z., Krish P., Mobile learning readiness among Malaysian students at higher learning institutes, Asian Soc Sci, 8, 12, (2012); Ibrahim R., Jaafar A., Educational games (EG) design framework: Combination of game design, pedagogy and content modeling.

Adopting new technology and changing biosciences education models, processes, and procedures has posed challenges to all stakeholders within the ecosystem. Aside from the move to online or distance learning, bioscience courses in higher education also necessitate the development of critical practical skills, which is yet to be fully addressed in digital platform context. This article examines the challenges and issues that biosciences education faces, as well as the tactics, methodologies, and alternatives that have been employed in the present pandemic context to reform biosciences education to enhance its resiliency and sustainability. This article also defines effective teaching criteria in biosciences education and considers whether higher education institutions can use virtual learning to offer the newest bioscience skills and knowledge to be future-proof and job-ready. © 2022 UPM Press.

An instructor has the power to influence a student's education through guidance, mentorship, and encouragement. This influence could be the factor that determines whether a student will become a motivated practitioner. The aim of this study was to identify whether dental schools are providing motivation to students to excel in their career and to become life-long learners. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was distributed electronically during 2020–2021 to Canadian dental students via email, social media, etc. The questionnaire included questions on demographics, the dental school environment, instructor evaluation, and dental student perspectives on education. Results: Of the 318 participants, 95.7% indicated their school follows a pass/fail system in some to all courses. Note that 61.2% found didactic components were weighted more heavily than clinical components. A greater number of participants found that their clinical instructors were more invested than their didactic instructors, in seeing their students become successful (53.0%) and excellent (44.6%) in their future careers. A total of 84.7% have not found a mentor, and 76% are not interested. Most participants indicated they are “moderately” motivated by their instructors to take continuing education courses (41.3%) and “not at all” motivated to continue their studies in a hospital (42.1%) or speciality residency program (56.3%). Conclusions: Instructors, educators, and mentors play a vital role in shaping dental student motivation in didactic and clinical courses, and beyond the school environment. Teaching institutions should incorporate opportunities for mentorship and student feedback to improve the delivery of dental education. Further studies may include assessing the role of mentorship at dental schools. © 2022 American Dental Education Association.","clinical practice; dental schools; dental students; didactic classes; mentors","Canada; Humans; Mentors; Motivation; Students, Dental; Surveys and Questionnaires; adult; article; career; clinical practice; demographics; dental education; dental student; e-mail; education; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mentor; motivation; questionnaire; social media; teaching; Canada; motivation","","","","","","","Girotto L.C., Enns S.C., de Oliveira M.S., Et al., Preceptors’ perception of their role as educators and professionals in a health system, BMC Med Educ, 19, 1, (2019); Panzavecchia L., Pearce R., Are preceptors adequately prepared for their role in supporting newly qualified staff?, Nurse Educ Today, 34, pp. 1119-1124, (2014); Hababeh M.O., Lalithabai D.S., Nurse trainees' perception of effective clinical instructor characteristics, Int J Nurs Sci, 7, 3, pp. 285-290, (2020); Ali W., Caring and effective teaching behavior of clinical nursing instructors in the clinical area as perceived by their students, J Educ Pract, 3, 7, pp. 15-25, (2012); Henzi D., Davis E., Jasinevicius R., Et al., Appraisal of the dental school learning environment: the students' view, J Dent Educ, 69, pp. 1137-1147, (2005); Myers B., Beliefs of dental faculty and students about effective clinical teaching behaviors, J Dent Educ, 41, pp. 68-76, (1977); Schonwetter D.J., Lavigne S., Mazurat R., Nazarko O., Students' perceptions of effective classroom and clinical teaching in dental and dental hygiene education, J Dent Educ, 70, pp. 624-635, (2006); Divaris K., Barlow P.J., Chendea S.A., Et al., The academic environment: the students' perspective, Eur J Dent Educ, 12, pp. 120-130, (2008); Subramanian J., Anderson V.R., Morgaine K.C., Thomson W.M., The importance of ‘student voice’ in dental education, Eur J Dent Educ, 17, pp. 136-141, (2013); Harvey L., Student feedback, Qual Higher Educ, 9, pp. 3-20, (2003); Cook-Sather A., Authorizing students' perspectives: towards trust, dialogue, and change in education, Educ Res, 31, pp. 3-14, (2002); Field J.C., Cowpe J.G., Walmsley A.D., The graduating European dentist: a new undergraduate curriculum framework, Eur J Dent Educ, 21, 1, pp. 2-10, (2017); Serrano C.M., Lagerweij M.D., de Boer I.R., Et al., Students’ learning environment perception and the transition to clinical training in dentistry, Eur J Dent Educ, 25, pp. 829-236, (2021); Chambers D.W., Geissberger M., Leknius C., Association amongst factors thought to be important by instructors in dental education and perceived effectiveness of these instructors by students, Eur J Dent Educ, 8, pp. 147-151, (2004); Ray M., Milston A., Doherty P., Crean S., In their own words: investigating the preparedness of final year dental students in the UK for independent general dental practice, Br Dent J, 225, 4, pp. 340-349, (2018); Oliver G.R., Lynch C.D., Chadwick B.L., Et al., What I wish I'd learned at dental school, Br Dent J, 221, 4, pp. 187-194, (2016); Brownstein S.A., Murad A., Hunt R.J., Implementation of new technologies in U.S. dental school curricula, J Dent Educ, 79, 3, pp. 259-264, (2015); Robinson F.G., Fischbach H., Salisbury J., Et al., Clinical integration in a dental school clinic through an enhanced patient intake process, J Dent Educ, 83, 9, pp. 1030-1038, (2019); Ba-Ali S., Jemec G.B., Sander B., Et al., The effect of two grading systems on the performance of medical students during oral examinations, Dan Med J, 64, 3, (2017); Montas M., Rao S.R., Atassi H.A., Et al., Relationship of grit and resilience to dental students' academic success, J Dent Educ, 85, 2, pp. 176-186, (2021); Khehra A., Levin L., Editorial: motivate dental professionals to be the best they can be, Quintessence Int, 52, 2, pp. 101-102, (2021); Chiappelli F., Evidence-based dentistry: two decades and beyond, J Evid Based Dent Pract, 19, 1, pp. 7-16, (2019); Levin L., Editorial: dental education–are we losing track?

However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of surgical videos on learning and understanding complex three-dimensional surgical procedures. Lower extremity amputation is a complex surgery, and many residents and surgeons have low exposure to this type of procedures. This paper investigates the educational quality of lower extremity amputation videos posted on YouTube. Methods: The search was limited to the first 100 videos. Full-length videos of any major lower limb amputation or disarticulation were included. Key basic video data such as title, YouTube address (http://), country of origin, channel source, uploading date, video duration time, number of views, number of up-voters and number of down-voters were collected. An educational assessment tool has been developed specifically for limb amputations. It consists in 11 items: three general and eight amputation-specific, each having a maximum score of 2. Results: In total, 13 videos met the inclusion criteria for final analysis. Four videos reported the surgical technique of above knee amputation, two reported that of knee disarticulation and the remaining seven videos described below knee amputation. The average score (±SD) was 12.77 ± 5.2 yielding an average grade close to “Fair.” A high level of concordance was found between the two assessors (κ = 0.79). No correlation was found between educational assessment tool score and the pre-set variables (r = 0.6, R2 = 35.4%, F = 1.09, P = 0.4). Conclusions: Most videos describing lower extremity amputation techniques were found to be of low-to-moderate quality. Only 4 out of 13 (30.7%) had an excellent educational and technical quality. Surgeons and surgical residents should be aware that not all posted videos on YouTube are beneficial. High educational quality videos are needed since many surgeons and residents have a low exposure to such surgeries. © The Author(s) 2020.","amputation; medical education; Videos; YouTube","Amputation; Clinical Competence; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Medical, Graduate; Educational Status; Humans; Internship and Residency; Lower Extremity; Quality Control; Social Media; Surgeons; Video Recording; above knee amputation; adult; article; below knee amputation; controlled study; human; knee amputation; medical education; resident; surgical technique; videorecording; amputation; clinical competence; education; educational status; lower limb; medical education; procedures; quality control; social media; surgeon; surgery; teaching","","","","","","","Pugh C.M., Watson A., Bell R.H., Et al., Surgical education in the internet era, J Surg Res, 156, pp. 177-182, (2009); Glass N.E., Kulaylat A.N., Zheng F., Et al., A national survey of educational resources utilized by the Resident and Associate Society of the American College of Surgeons membership, Am J Surg, 209, pp. 59-64, (2015); Mayer R.E., Applying the science of learning: evidence-based principles for the design of multimedia instruction, Am Psychol, 63, pp. 760-769, (2008); Friedl R., Hoppler H., Ecard K., Et al., Multimedia-driven teaching significantly improves students’ performance when compared with a print medium, Ann Thorac Surg, 81, pp. 1760-1766, (2006); Mendez A., Seikaly H., Ansari K., Et al., High definition video teaching module for learning neck dissection, J Otolaryngol – Head Neck Surg, 43, (2014); Pape-Koehler C., Immenroth M., Sauerland S., Et al., Multimedia-based training on Internet platforms improves surgical performance: a randomized controlled trial, Surg Endosc, 27, pp. 1737-1747, (2013); Rapp A.K., Healy M.G., Charlton M.E., Et al., YouTube is the most frequently used educational video source for surgical preparation, J Surg Educ, 73, pp. 1072-1076, (2016); Frongia G., Mehrabi A., Fonouni H., Et al., YouTube as a potential training resource for laparoscopic fundoplication, J Surg Educ, 73, pp. 1066-1071, (2016); de'Angelis N., Gavriilidis P., Martinez-Perez A., Et al., Educational value of surgical videos on YouTube: quality assessment of laparoscopic appendectomy videos by senior surgeons vs. novice trainees, World J Emerg Surg, 14, (2019); Poon C., Stevens S.M., Golub J.S., Et al., Pilot study evaluating the impact of otology surgery videos on otolaryngology resident education, Otol Neurotol, 38, pp. 423-428, (2017); Lee J.S., Seo H.S., Hong T.H., YouTube as a potential training method for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, Ann Surg Treat Res, 89, pp. 92-97, (2015); Koya K.D., Bhatia K.R., Hsu J.T., Et al., YouTube and the expanding role of videos in dermatologic surgery education, Semin Cutan Med Surg, 31, pp. 163-167, (2012); Fischer J., Geurts J., Valderrabano V., Et al., Educational quality of YouTube videos on knee arthrocentesis, J Clin Rheumatol, 19, pp. 373-376, (2013)","K.

To bridge didactic learning and the complexity of practice, the VEP-SANE team designed an innovative, competency-based CI. Fifteen trainees from Cohort 1 and 19 trainees from Cohort 2 met requirements for CI participation. Trainees in Cohort 1 represented the advanced practice registered nurse specialties of emergency, women's health, and pediatrics. For Cohort 2 recruitment, enrollment was expanded to include family and midwifery advanced practice registered nurse specialties. Trainees were required to complete online training modules before CI participation. Online surveys assessed trainee perceptions about levels of knowledge and confidence related to sexual assault nurse examiner competencies (pre/post CI), each CI session, and the overall CI experience. Separate focused discussions were conducted with trainees and faculty after each CI. Both cohorts rated CI sessions as ""excellent""or ""very good""over 93% of the time. Perceived levels of knowledge and confidence increased from pre-CI to post-CI for both cohorts. Similar CI strengths were identified across trainees and faculty including speakers, high interactivity, safe environment, reality of cases, and surrogate practice. All trainees indicated readiness for preceptorships and interest in a virtual community of practice. Suggestions included more time for laboratory sessions, documenting photos, and interaction with individuals from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and presenters. Future efforts focus on CI conversion to a virtual format because of the impact of COVID-19, increased VEP-SANE community of practice interaction, and expanded engagement with practicing sexual assault nurse examiners.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Competency-based education; educational assessment; forensic nursing; nursing education; nursing education graduate; patient simulation","Child; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Immersion; Nurses; SARS-CoV-2; Sex Offenses; child; female; human; immersion; nurse; sexual crime","","","","","Bureau of Health Workforce, (T96HP32512); National Institutes of Health, NIH, (NCATS/NIH UL1 TR000445); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS","This study was supported by (a) U.S. Department of Health and Human Service - Bureau of Health Workforce Grant T96HP32512 and (b) The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences/National Institutes of Health Grant NCATS/NIH UL1 TR000445.

Since the middle of twentieth century, computers have changed people’s way of thinking and habits at an amazing speed. Digital technology has a profound influence on the artistic expression and language form changes. At present, the development of various digital technologies has emerged in an endless stream, which has brought a bright future for the development of digital technology in China. The digital media art major is an applied subject, and the practical teaching occupies an important position in the whole teaching system. In recent years, new design concepts, new means of expression, new technology and so on are constantly emerging, and the requirements for design talents are becoming higher and higher. In the construction of practical teaching system, we should focus on the reform and construction of professional courses, formulate the planning ideas of curriculum construction, and revise the teaching plan, update the contents of practice teaching, and form a plan to improve teaching quality. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Art design; Digital technology; Information technology; Innovation","Data handling; Digital storage; E-learning; Embedded systems; Information technology; Art design; Curriculum constructions; Digital technologies; Practical teachings; Practice teachings; Teaching quality; Teaching systems; Twentieth century; Arts computing","","","","","Education Department of Sichuan Province, (15ZA0352)","This paper is one of the phased achievements of the key project of Sichuan Education Department in 2015 (15ZA0352).","Allen J., Digital media in architectural design education: Reflections on the e-studio pedagogy, Art Design & Communication in Higher Education, 4, 3, pp. 205-222, (2005); Chen L., Digital Media Design and Development of Graphic Design Education, (2005); Chang L., The Discussion about the Characteristics and Influence of Digital Media Art Design, (2017); Ford K., The pool model: Foregrounding an alternative learning and teaching approach for digital media design in higher education, Art, 9, 1, pp. 57-73, (2010); French K., The pool model: Foregrounding an alternative learning and teaching approach for digital media design in higher education, Art, 9, 1, pp. 57-73, (2010); Ham Y., Li X., An analysis on the dynamic design of e-books of digital information media in present China, International Conference on System Science, Engineering Design and Manufacturing Information, 1, pp. 93-97, (2012); Hon S., New Media Art and Design in Digital Age, (2010); Jogjakarta M., Btu and School of Planning and Media Design is Funded by Edu as a Partner in the Art Line Project Bleeding Institute of Technology is a Partner in the South Balti Cross-Border Cooperation Prong, (2011); Hostler S.C., Integrating Mathematics, theory and creativity: Visualizing proportional structures in digital media, Design Collection, 3, pp. 279-292, (2011); Ken H.U., Polytechnic G.I., Research on the reform of art design personnel training mode in higher vocational colleges—Taking digital media art design specialty as an example, Journal of Guangdong Industry Technical College, (2016); Knight J., Subroutine M., Understanding the user: Research methods to support the digital media designer, Research Issues in Art, (2002); Moe Y., Geo L., Huang J., Application of Digital Media Art in Architectural Decoration Design in Industrial 4.0 Era.

However, student attitudes regarding classroom engagement, academic performance, and overall teaching effectiveness toward this tool have been mixed. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of live-feed on students' classroom engagement. Educational activity and setting: This study included the use of live-feed in a research and statistics course for first-year pharmacy students. At the end of the course, students were invited to participate in a post-survey to assess impressions on classroom engagement after the usage of live-feed in the classroom. Findings: Fifty out of 62 students (81%) responded to the survey. Seventy percent reported that live-feed application promoted collaborative learning and discussion, and 68% stated that it increased their understanding of the topic. Sixty-six percent reported that live-feed application created a supportive anonymous environment, and 64% felt it encouraged them to ask questions. Sixty percent of the students reported that live-feed did not increase their engagement in the classroom but agreed that it lowered their anxiety toward class participation. Sixty-four percent of the students were positive about live-feed boosting their willingness to participate in topic discussions and 72% believed that live-feed made learning a fun activity. Live-feed can be a useful tool in academic settings to provide a supportive environment and promote students' willingness to participate in classroom discussions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Classroom discussion; Live-streaming software; Student engagement","Education, Distance; Education, Pharmacy; Humans; Social Media; Students, Pharmacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; anxiety; article; collaborative learning; human; major clinical study; pharmacy student; software; education; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; social media","","","","","","","Hollis R.B., Was C.A., Mind wandering, control failures, and social media distractions in online learning, Learn Instr, 42, pp. 104-112, (2016); Mckay M., Sanko J.S., Shekhter I., Birnbach D.J., Twitter as a tool to enhance student engagement during an interprofessional patient safety course, J Interprof Care, 28, 6, pp. 565-567, (2014); Perkmann M., Tartari V., McKelvey M., Et al., Academic engagement and commercialisation: a review of the literature on university–industry relations, Res Policy, 42, 2, pp. 423-442, (2013); Reschly A.L., Christenson S.L., Jingle, jangle, and conceptual haziness: evolution and future directions of the engagement construct, Handbook of research on student engagement, pp. 3-19, (2012); Evans C., Twitter for teaching: can social media be used to enhance the process of learning?, Br J Educ Technol, 45, 5, pp. 902-915, (2014); Frequently asked questions | poll everywhere; IBM Corp, IBM SPSS statistics for windows, version 23.0, (2017); Cain J., Policastri A., Using Facebook as an informal learning environment, Am J Pharm Educ, 75, 10, (2011); DiVall M.V., Kirwin J.L., Using Facebook to facilitate course-related discussion between students and faculty members, Am J Pharm Educ, 76, 2, (2012); Estus E.L., Using Facebook within a geriatric pharmacotherapy course, Am J Pharm Educ, 74, 8, (2010); Berg DR, Twitter in the engineering classroom, J Online Eng Educ, 6, 2, (2016); AlFaris E., Irfan F., Ponnamperuma G., Et al., The pattern of social media use and its association with academic performance among medical students, Med Teach, 40, sup 1, pp. S77-S82, (2018); Ricoy M.-C., Feliz T., Twitter as a learning community in higher education, J Educ Techno Soc, 19, 1, pp. 237-248, (2016); Webb A.L., Dugan A., Burchett W., Et al., Effect of a novel engagement strategy using Twitter on test performance, West J Emerg Med, 16, 6, pp. 961-964, (2015); Camiel L.D., Goldman-Levine J.D., Kostka-Rokosz M.D., McCloskey W.W., Twitter as an in-class backchannel tool in a large required pharmacy course, Am J Pharm Educ, 78, 3, (2014); Kassens A.L., Tweeting your way to improved #writing, #reflection, and #community, J Econ Educ, 45, 2, pp. 101-109, (2014)","A.

The sudden shift of teaching mode has resulted in unplanned challenges. The main concerns among teachers and students include teaching quality and learning effectiveness. To examine the effectiveness of interpreting teaching and learning online, we conducted a survey about students' perceptions of satisfaction concerning online interpreting teaching and learning via an online platform. This survey is composed of questions to measure student satisfaction from six aspects, namely, instructor, technology, setup, interaction, outcomes, and overall. Results showed that the shift to abrupt online interpreting teaching and learning did not have any significant impact on teaching quality and learning effectiveness. Findings also highlighted the need for further investigation of self-regulation and self-directiveness in online interpreting teaching and learning. Essential pedagogical tasks can be conducted online (e.g., triangulation exercises, relays, handover, and channel switching).

IT application has shaped education in the 21st century. Computational thinking has provided further impetus for building an all-encompassing social network and fostering a DIY culture enabled by digital technologies. One empirical study used four apps to test children's development in computational thinking and fluency. The article will help students overcome their fears of coding. Peer reviews provide students with an opportunity to learn from each other and become more motivated. These reviews also serve as feedback for teachers to evaluate students' performance. Experimental design is used in this study, and a peer review system is implemented. Freshmen attending a programming class in a university are used as samples. At the class, students write computer programs with f-Chart, which provides a graphical user interface for students to learn programming logic and design. Zuvio, a cloud-based interactive response system, is used to conduct the peer reviews. The data of this study are analyzed through R. The results show not only an improvement in students' learning performance but also a gap between students' peer review scores and teachers' evaluation scores.

For dogs, Vas and colleagues developed a 13-item questionnaire to measure inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (Dog ARS; 2007). We re-assessed, in a large sample of dogs (N = 319), psychometric properties of the Dog ARS, to identify possible limitations as a basis for further development. We examined the cross-study stability of factor structure and 40-day temporal stability of item and subscale scores and compared owner-report with expert (dog trainer)-report (n = 86), paralleling human parent/teacher assessments. To identify ambiguous items, we administered a modified version (including “I don’t know” options, N = 520) to a different sample. We could replicate the factor structure with evidence of good internal consistency and test–retest reliability of both subscales. Agreement between owner and trainer ratings was fair (inattention) and moderate (hyperactivity/impulsivity). Three ambiguous items were identified. Overall, we claim that the Dog ARS is a reliable tool to assess ADHD-like behaviour in dogs, but in its current form, it is not suitable to detect diagnosable individuals, as it does not comprise items assessing functional impairment, and also, the inclusion of owner-expert ratings in the evaluation process would be necessary. © 2022 by the authors.

We offer results from an intercollegiate collaboration that provides an innovative learning environment through a social media education ecosystem. Participating students discuss current marketing topics with peers, marketing practitioners, and faculty to reinforce course concepts, improve learning perceptions, and increase professional communication skills and networking opportunities. An initial exploratory study provides a snapshot of Twitter analytics, illustrating the reach of students’ marketing-related discussions. Next, survey data collected from students show increased learning satisfaction and favorable behavioral intentions. Finally, tweets from the 12-week project were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Results suggest that participants improved their professional communication skills while using language that provokes greater cognitive processes. Implications for marketing educators and future directions for the project are also provided. © The Author(s) 2018.","experiential learning techniques; innovative teaching methods; measuring teaching effectiveness; skills/traits development in marketing education; surveys; written communication","","","","","","","","Ackerman D.S., Gross B.L., Perner L., Instructor, student, and employer perception on preparing marketing students for changing business landscapes, Journal of Marketing Education, 25, pp. 46-56, (2003); Anderson L.W., Krathwohl D.R., A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives, (2001); Aviv R., Ravid G., Reciprocity analysis of online learning networks, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 9, 4, pp. 3-13, (2005); Bal A.S., Grewal D., Mills A., Ottley G., Engaging students with social media, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, pp. 190-203, (2015); Beaudreau S.A., Storandt M., Strube M.J., A comparison of narratives told by younger and older adults, Experimental Aging Research, 32, pp. 105-117, (2006); Blessing S.B., Blessing J.S., Fleck B.K., Using Twitter to reinforce classroom concepts, Teaching of Psychology, 39, pp. 268-271, (2012); Boyatzis R.E., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); Brush C.G., Exploring the concept of an entrepreneurship education ecosystem, Innovative pathways for university entrepreneurship in the 21st century, pp. 25-39, (2014); Casey S., Nielsen Social Media Report, (2017); Chen J., Hsieh G., Mahmud J., Nichols J., Understanding individuals’ personal values from social media word use, pp. 405-414, (2014); Clarke T.B., Nelson C.L., Classroom community, pedagogical effectiveness, and learning outcomes associated with Twitter use in undergraduate marketing courses, Journal for Advancement of Marketing Education, 20, pp. 29-38, (2012); Cohn M.A., Mehl M.R., Pennebaker J.W., Linguistic markers of psychological change surrounding, Psychological Science, 15, 10, pp. 687-693, (2004); Crittenden V., Crittenden W., Digital and Social Media Marketing in Business Education: Implications for the Marketing Curriculum, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, 3, pp. 131-132, (2015); Dowell D.J., Small F.A., What is the impact of online resource materials on student self-learning strategies?, Journal of Marketing Education, 33, pp. 140-148, (2011); Duffy K., Ney J., Exploring the divides among students, educators, and practitioners in the use of digital media as a pedagogical tool, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, pp. 104-113, (2015); Dunham K., The beginner’s guide to social media metrics: Engagement, (2014); Dunlap J.C., Lowenthal P.R., Tweeting the night away: Using Twitter to enhance social presence, Journal of Information Systems Education, 20, pp. 129-135, (2009); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research, (1975); Gao F., Luo T., Zhang K., Tweeting for learning: A critical analysis of research on microblogging in education published in 2008–2011, British Journal of Educational Technology, 43, pp. 783-801, (2012); Hancock J.T., Beaver D.I., Chung C.K., Frazee J., Pennebaker J.W., Graesser A., Cai Z., Social language processing: A framework for analyzing the communication of terrorists and authoritarian regimes, Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism & Political Aggression, 2, pp. 108-132, (2010); Handelsman M.M., Briggs W.L., Sullivan N., Towler A., A measure of college student course engagement, Journal of Educational Research, 98, pp. 184-192, (2005); Heiberger G., Harper R., Have you Facebooked Astin lately?

Using simple and weighted counts of papers along with network measures of Total Degree centrality and Bonacich Power centrality, we provide rankings of top authors and institutions in the field of Operations Management (OM) serving as hubs of research, connectivity, and productivity from across the world. In view of benefits that can accrue from increased research collaboration between academicians and practitioners, we examine the levels of practitioner participation in the research works published across these premier journals. We survey the extent to which the top ranked authors and institutions network with practitioners in producing joint publications in these journals. By identifying the top ranked authors and institutions in OM, this study provides information that can be useful to stakeholders who may wish to engage in collaborative research with the leading agents, or pursue educational opportunities with them. The study also presents a profile of productivity levels and what it takes for authors and institutions to rank among the top tiers. In so doing, it offers insights into yearly publication rates and underlying trends—insights that can be useful in the context of promotion and tenure, faculty evaluations, and in assessing the standings of individuals and institutions relative to leadership benchmarks. © 2020 Decision Sciences Institute","Faculty Evaluation;

Because of this, it is very important to assess how well teachers are performing with this new way of online teaching. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a new field that emerged from using data mining techniques to analyze educational data and making decision based on findings. EDM can be utilized to gain better understanding about students and their learning processes, assist teachers do their academic tasks, and make judgments about how to manage educational system. The primary objective of this study is to uncover the key factors that influence the quality of teaching in a virtual classroom environment. Data is gathered from the students’ evaluation of teaching from computer science students of three online semesters at X University. In total, 27622 students participated in these survey. Weka, sentimental analysis, and word cloud generator are applied in the process of carrying out the research. The decision tree classifies the factors affecting the performance of the teachers, and we find that student-faculty relation is the most prominent factor for improving the teaching quality. The sentimental analysis reveals that around 78% of opinions are positive and “good” is the most frequently used word in the opinions. If the education system is moved online in the future, this research will help figure out what needs to be changed to improve teachers’ overall performance and the quality of their teaching. © 2022, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

Educational professionals and stakeholders have shown interest in learning how this change in the test mode influenced test takers; that is, whether test-taking experiences in a remote test setting were different from those in a standard test center setting. We propose an innovative approach that makes use of log data collected from the digital platforms of a high-stakes international test and applies data-mining techniques to address the mode effect. In the study, the test-taking behaviors were measured by where students spent their time during the test, extracted from log files collected from both remote test and test center modes. Results showed that four distinct clusters existed among students' test-taking behaviors, regardless of the test modes and students' test scores. Within each cluster, statistically significant behavioral differences existed between the two mode groups; however, the magnitude of the mode effect was limited by where students spent their time during the test. © 2021 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","data mining; remote testing; test-taking behavior","","","","","","Matt Johnson","The author would like to thank Matt Johnson and Dan McCaffrey for helpful discussions; Lixiong Gu and Zhuangzhuang Han for providing data information; Chen Li, Chunyi Ruan, and Wenju Chui for providing raw log data; and Paul Jewsbury and Sooyeon Kim for editorial help on the earlier version of the paper.

In 2020 every educational institution moved their didactics toward an online platform. Every course had to introduce and experiment with new forms of didactics that prevent in-person events, either in lectures or laboratory. Courses of design traditionally require a strict relation between student-instructor and student-student. The need to operate by moving the contact to an online connection creates, at the beginning of the period, a lot of distrust among teachers of such courses. The “Machine Drawing” course is one of these. Briefly recalling how the courses have been revised, with the employment of a communication platform like Teams®, the answers, given by students, are collected and the differences along the time are highlighted. Three academic years have been considered: 2017-2018, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021. A further correlation has been made considering different didactics and the global efficiency of the course in terms of abandonment, number of successes (number of people that pass the exam), and the effects on the grades (marks) obtained. Reflecting on such data, a new consideration has been done on the methodologies that can still continue to be used in the future when the explicit problem of pandemic emergency does will not influence anymore the traditional way of teaching. © Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Disrupt, Innovate, Regenerate and Transform, E and PDE 2022.

This paper analyzes the connotation of blended learning and the shortcomings of traditional teaching, it is believed that traditional classroom teaching mode and pure online teaching mode can no longer meet the needs of talents training in higher education institutions in the era of ""internet+"". Blended learning is the direction of teaching reform in colleges and universities, and it is an important practice trend of higher education informatization. The implementation of blended learning is not simply a combination of online teaching and classroom teaching, but a systematic project, which needs to be determined from the teaching objectives, teaching link design, online platform construction, classroom teaching guidance, teaching effect evaluation, etc. Starting from the pre-class knowledge learning, in-depth discussion in the class, after-class consolidation and expansion, curriculum assessment and evaluation, teaching effect reflection and other links, we truly achieve the result of ""teaching is methodical and learning is effective""to help students learn independently and efficiently to improve teaching effectiveness and students' practical innovation ability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Electronic assessment; Learning systems; Students; Colleges and universities; Curriculum assessment; Higher education institutions; Innovation abilities; Knowledge learning; Online teaching modes; Teaching effectiveness; Teaching objectives; E-learning","","","","","","","Yu Xinjie, On the six relations of blended learning Teaching in Chinese Universities 14-18+28, (2019); Zhang Jin, Du Shangrong, Connotation, value appeal and implementation path of blended learning Teaching and Management, pp. 11-13, (2020); Zhao Wenjie, Wu Haibin, Feng Qiaohua, Exploring the evaluation mechanism of blended learning assessment based on Internet + Heilongjiang Education (Higher Education Research and Evaluation), pp. 46-48, (2020); Liang Rui, The Application of blended learning Mode in Marketing Major, Chinese Journal of Multimedia and Network Teaching, pp. 81-82, (2019); Feng Xiaoying, Wang Ruixue, The core goal-oriented hybrid learning design model in the Internet+ era, China Distance Education, pp. 19-93, (2019); Han Xiaoling, Xu Juan, Construction of evaluation index system of blended learning curriculum resources, Modern Education Technology, 28, pp. 34-40, (2018); Wang Yang, The effect and evaluation of blended learning based on the Rain Class room project-based curriculum Vocational Education Forum, pp. 70-75, (2020)","C.

Methods: The 10 most highly viewed pediatric and congenital cataract procedural videos published within the past 10 years were independently reviewed by three separate board-certified, fellowship-trained, practicing pediatric ophthalmologists. Videos were assessed for surgical competency on a 5-point Likert scale in six key areas as outlined in the American Academy of Ophthalmology's congenital cataract surgery guidelines. The teaching quality of the videos was also subjectively assessed based on multiple measures. Results: The mean overall score was 3.93 ± 0.94 (range: 2.67 to 4.67). Only one video failed to receive an overall score of greater than 3, indicating incompetent overall surgical performance. No other video failed to have a mean competent score for any single individual technique. One video demonstrated potential patient safety concerns. Eighty percent of videos had adequate or better picture quality. Conclusions: Of the 10 most popular pediatric cataract surgical videos published on YouTube, all but one displayed competent overall surgical technique. Although viewers must always be wary because unvetted and potentially harmful videos may be published on the platform at any time, if used correctly, surgical content published on YouTube can be a helpful tool for ophthalmologic trainees. © 2022 Slack Incorporated.

Several studies have been performed to show the effectiveness of computer-assisted assessment (CAA) and it has been accepted in various education sectors. However, due to the lack of sufficient infrastructure and other issues, the paper-based examination is still being used for educational assessment in many countries including India. Existing CAA frameworks require the examination to be conducted on a digital platform. So, these do not apply to paper answer books. We propose a two-phase framework for automatic evaluation of handwritten answer books. The first phase converts the answers written on papers to a digital form using a neural network-based handwritten answer recognizer. The second phase evaluates the answer to generate a numerical score. For this evaluation, we use a model answer-based approach where various levels of similarities between the model answer and a student answer are computed. To assess the performance of the developed system, we apply it to the evaluation of class VII Social Science Geography answer books of an Indian school. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach is quite promising. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Automatic answer evaluation; Computer-assisted assessment; Educational assessment; Handwritten answer book; Handwritten character recognition","","","","","","","","Alikaniotis D., Yannakoudakis H., Rei M., Automatic text scoring using neural networks, Corr, Abs/1606.04289., (2016); Baker E., Mayer R.E., Computer-based assessment of problem solving, Computers in Human Behavior, 15, 3, pp. 269-282, (1999); Burrows S., Gurevych I., Stein B., The eras and trends of automatic short answer grading, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25, 1, pp. 60-117, (2015); Burstein J., Kukich K., Wolff S., Lu C., Chodorow M., Enriching automated scoring using discourse marking, Proceedings of the Workshop on Discourse Relations and Discourse Marking in ACL-1998, (1998); Callear D.H., Jerrams-Smith J., Soh V., CAA of short non-MCQ answers, Proceedings of the 5Th International CAA Conference, (2001); Cartwright G.F., Derevensky J.L., An attitudinal study of computer-assisted testing as a learning method, Psychology in the Schools, 13, 3, pp. 317-321, (1975); Chapelle C.A., Voss E., 20 years of technology and language assessment in, Language Learning & Technology, 20, 2, pp. 116-128, (2016); Clariana R., Wallace P., Paper–based versus computer–based assessment: Key factors associated with the test mode effect, British Journal of Educational Technology, 33, 5, pp. 593-602, (2002); Conneau A., Douwe K., Holger S., Loic B., Bordes A., Supervised learning of universal sentence representations from natural language inference data, 1, (2017); Croft A.C., Danson M., Dawson B.R., Ward J.P., Experiences of using computer assisted assessment in engineering mathematics, Computers & Education, 37, 1, pp. 53-66, (2001); Dumais S.T., Latent semantic analysis, Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 38, pp. 188-230, (2005); Dzikovska M.O., Nielsen R.D., Brew C., Leacock C., Giampiccolo D., Bentivogli L., Dang H.T., Semeval-2013 task 7: The joint student response analysis and 8th recognizing textual entailment challenge, Proceedings of Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (Semev Al 2013), (2013); Fisteus J.A., Pardo A., Garcia N.F., Grading multiple choice exams with low-cost and portable computer-vision techniques, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 22, 4, pp. 560-571, (2013); Foltz P.W., Laham D., Landauer T.K., Automated essay scoring: Applications to educational technology, Proceedings of ED-MEDIA Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Telecommunications., (1999); Khoshsima H., Hosseini M., Toroujeni S.M.H., Cross-mode comparability of Computer-Based Testing (CBT) versus Paper-Pencil Based Testing (PPT): An investigation of testing administration mode among Iranian intermediate EFL learners, English Language Teaching, 10, 2, pp. 23-32, (2017); Leacock C., Chodorow M., C-rater: Automated scoring of short-answer questions, Computers and the Humanities, 37, 4, pp. 389-405, (2003); Levenshtein V.I., Binary codes capable of correcting deletions, insertions and reversals, Soviet Physics Doklady, 10, (1966); Manmatha R., Srimal N., Scale space technique for word segmentation in handwritten documents, In International Conference on Scale-Space Theories in Computer Vision, pp. 22-33, (1999); Marti U., Bunke H., The IAM-database: An English sentence database for off-line handwriting recognition, Int.

Multiple researchers have introduced nontraditional teaching methods, but there is no scientific consensus on the best nontraditional teaching methods that are tailored to learners’ abilities while most effectively addressing the course objectives. Therefore, the goal of this review was to address the following questions across all engineering disciplines, based on learners’ abilities and the course objectives: (a) What are the benefits of nontraditional teaching methods? and (b) How would you categorize the benefits of nontraditional teaching methods? A qualitative review was conducted to achieve these goals, and the initial search for papers, using relevant keywords, resulted in more than 2000 peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2000 and 2017. A total of 125 peer-reviewed articles pertaining to the most frequently studied nontraditional teaching methods were comprehensively studied and analyzed. The analysis resulted in practical guidelines, including a list of the benefits of the five studied nontraditional teaching methods (flipped classroom, gamification, case study, self-learning, and social media) belonging to four categories: technical/professional, personal skills/ability, personal attitude, and time and space. Based on the results, the authors established significant guidelines for instructors who aim to optimize learners’ achievements by adopting the most effective teaching styles, based on their course objectives and the learners’ abilities. © 2019 by the authors.

The purpose of this research is to understand the motivation factors that impact international student choices in selecting Indian higher education as a study-abroad destination. This quantitative study examines the choice criteria of 249 full-time international students from the countries of Asia and Africa. A number of choice factors were identified. Results indicate that international students at Indian universities consider ‘university characteristics’ and ‘influence of social networks’ as the most important motivation factors that determine destination choice. The study findings suggest a value proposition canvas consisting of teaching quality, university rankings, safety and availability of academic courses as its foremost constituents. The paper notes decision-making influences and identifies implications for marketing actions of a developing host country operating in a competitive international student market. © The Author(s) 2020.","choice criteria; Indian higher education; International student mobility; marketing strategy","","","","","","","","Abubakar B., Shanka T., Muuka G.N., Tertiary education: An investigation of location selection criteria and preferences by international students – the case of two Australian universities, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 20, 1, pp. 49-68, (2010); Ahmad A.B., Shah M., International students’ choice to study in China: An exploratory study, Tertiary Education and Management, 24, 4, pp. 325-337, (2018); Binsardi A., Ekwulugo F., International marketing of British education: Research on the students’ perception and the UK market penetration, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 21, 5, pp. 318-327, (2003); Chan S.J., Shifting patterns of student mobility in Asia, Higher Education Policy, 25, 2, pp. 207-224, (2012); Chen L.H., Internationalization or international marketing?

This research takes Guangzhou's higher vocational tourism teachers as the main body of research. The interview method was used to obtain relevant information and data. Through data analysis and comparison, two main problems were found: From the perspective of teachers, teachers' attention to information literacy is mainly in the use of information technology, but not enough attention to basic knowledge, information ethics, etc.; the level of information technology skills of teachers is not high. From a school perspective, the school lacks enough attention to teacher information literacy, lack of regular training of information technology skills, and lack of relevant information technology hardware. In this regard, this research proposes corresponding countermeasures: popularize the application of teaching information technology; improve teacher information literacy, develop teacher teaching information technology ability training; formulate higher vocational teacher information literacy evaluation standards, and include teacher information literacy into the teacher assessment system.  © 2021 IEEE.","Information literacy; Information technology; Tourism categories","Big data; Personnel training; Tourism; Current situation; Evaluation standard; Information ethics; Information literacy; Information technology skills; Informatization; Network development; Teacher assessments; Engineering education","","","","","","","Professional Catalogue of Vocational Education""; Government Work Report, (2015); China Education Modernization 2035, (2017); Yan D., Theory of Information Culture.

Therefore, increase in student enrollment, retention and graduation rate is becoming very important, so is the need for effective teaching in these subjects. Many universities commonly use formal, institutional Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) systems to measure the teaching effectiveness. After each semester, through SET, students provide feedback and comments for their courses and instructors. However, evaluations are private and only a handful people have access to these. Therefore, these evaluations cannot be utilized to create a common understanding of the students' expectations, perspective, desired characteristics of the courses and instructors. On the other hand, third party online platforms like RateMyProfessor.com (RMP) are public, solicit anonymous student feedback and host tremendous amount of data about the instructors and their courses. These platforms are also popular among students. We mined and analyzed the RMP data for some research questions, e.g.: What are the common characteristics of the popular CS instructors? How different are they for the SE instructors? Are there any examples of special characteristics, tools and techniques popular CS instructors use? We captured and analyzed more than 9,000 students' comments for over 300 CS instructors for the top 20 universities in the U.S. and Canada. The paper contributes by presenting the findings for the research questions and making the data and the scripts available for public use for future research. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

Through bibliometric and network analysis, we register, over 19 years, 49 journals, 174 articles, 440 authors, 290 keywords and 4.283 references. From these data, we realized that most debates are characterized by the focus on higher education, by the authorship affiliated to public institutions, as well as by weaving approaches more focused on the validation of tests than on the quality of education. The results conclude that USP stands out as the institution with the largest number of publications, that the journal “Ensaio: Avaliação e Políticas Públicas em Educação” concentrates the largest number of publications in the area of Education and that the author Wagner Andriola from UFC is the most referenced researcher. These and other results of the research indicate the need to intensify studies in the field of Education assessment in order to better understand our weaknesses and then propose to correct routes and redefine goals. © 2022.

However, online business ethics education faces a challenge in which the lack of communication among teachers and students leads to a decline in teaching effectiveness. Social media applications can be imbedded in traditional ethics education to solve this problem. In this paper, based on the elaboration likelihood model and social media capabilities theory, we develop an integrated model to explain how the change in students’ attitudes about corporate social responsibility (CSR) happens in a social media-supported environment and how social media capabilities affect the processes. We conducted a teaching experiment and collected 233 valid samples of students to verify the hypothesis. Our study confirmed there are two mechanisms to affect students’ attitudes about CSR, source credibility, and argument quality. Concurrency has a moderating effect on attitudes change. Possible reasons, limitations, implications, and advice for future studies are also presented. © 2019 Society for Research into Higher Education.","Attitudes about CSR; elaboration likelihood model; ethics education;

Yet, no studies have been undertaken on the factors influencing undergraduate nursing students’ evaluation of teaching effectiveness in Namibia. Aim: To investigate the factors associated with undergraduate nursing students’ evaluation of teaching effectiveness at a higher education institution in Namibia. Methods and materials: A cross-sectional survey was used to collect data from 148 respondents, using an online survey. Data were analysed using SPSS version 27.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the respondents’ demographic characteristics while inferential statistics determined the relationship between the study variables. Results: The overall mean score of 3.16 ± 1.35 on students’ evaluation of teaching effectiveness was reasonably high. The correlation analysis showed a statistical significant correlation between the delivery and organisation factors (r = 0.2; p = < 0.05) on teaching effectiveness. The logistic analysis identified teaching preferences (β = 0.44; p = 0.00), program design encourage hard work (β = 0.43; p = 0.00), fair and immediate feedbacks (β = 0.42; p = 0.00), and interactive presentations (β = 0.39; p = 0.00) as factors influencing teaching effectiveness in this study. Conclusion: The results of this study identified that providing immediate feedback, and using unbiased tools and teaching methods were some of the major factors influencing teaching effectiveness in this study. Future studies should consider investigating the influence of students' and teachers' characteristics on teaching effectiveness. © 2022 The Author(s)","Namibia; Student evaluation of teaching; Teaching effectiveness; Undergraduate nursing students","adult; Article; comparative effectiveness; cross-sectional study; demographics; educational status; emotionality; female; health care survey; human; human experiment; job satisfaction; knowledge; Likert scale; male; Namibia; nursing student; perception; questionnaire; social distance; social media; social status; teaching; undergraduate student; validation process; work environment","","","","","","","Ahea M., The value and effectiveness of feedback in improving students' learning and professionalizing teaching in higher education, Journal of Education and Practice, 7, 16, pp. 38-41, (2016); Boring A., Gender biases in student evaluations of teaching, Journal of Public Economics, 145, pp. 27-41, (2017); Boring A., Ottoboni K., Student evaluations of teaching (mostly) do not measure teaching effectiveness, ScienceOpen Research, pp. 1-11, (2016); Cho J.I., Hamash K., Otani K., Reimer N., Deng Y., Influential factors of student evaluations of teaching in a nursing program, Teaching and Learning in Nursing, 13, 2, pp. 86-94, (2018); Chowdhury F., Application of rubrics in the classroom: A vital tool for improvement in assessment, feedback and learning, International Education Studies, 12, 1, pp. 61-68, (2019); Constantinou C., Wijnen-Meijer M., Student evaluations of teaching and the development of a comprehensive measure of teaching effectiveness for medical schools, BMC Medical Education, 22, 1, pp. 1-14, (2022); Ding C., Sherman H., Teaching effectiveness and student achievement: Examining the relationship, Educational Research Quarterly, 29, 4, pp. 40-51, (2006); ElIdrissi W.E., Lajane H., Chemsi G., Radid M., Evaluation of clinical teaching by nursing students at the Higher Institute of Nursing and Health Techniques in Casablanca, Morocco, Journal of Educational and Social Research, 12, 2, (2022); Fernandez-Garcia C.M., Rodriguez-Alvarez M., Vinuela-Hernandez M.P., University students and their perception of teaching effectiveness.

The study included seventh and eighth grade students (N=432) of elementary schools in the City of Zagreb and Split-Dalmatia County. Besides demographic characteristics of students and the level of digital media equipment in schools, the data were collected by the Goal orientation questionnaire (CSRL), the Technology implementation questionnaire (TIQ), and Student perception of classroom quality questionnaire (SPOCQ). It was concluded that, overall, demographic characteristics of students, their goal orientations, the level of digital media equipment in schools and motivation for the use of digital media are significant predictors of student perception of classroom quality, with the highest percentage of variance explained by goal orientations and with emphasis on learning orientation. In this regard, it is evident that for the teaching quality in the digital age, goal orientation, i.e., motivation for learning, is more significant than the use of digital media. Comparison with theoretical postulates and implications of these results are explained in this paper. © 2019, FACTEACHEREDUCATION.

One of its many benefits is the implementation of pre-prepared situations in a safe environment. The introduction of simulation into theoretical training is beneficial for students, lecturers, and the faculty. Goal: To investigate the effectiveness of the simulation process for teaching nursing. Methods: This paper is a literary review. It is processed using a four-step system. We used the acronym PECOT. We used online platforms for the research, such as PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, EBSCO, and Scopus. We visited the Academic Library of the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice and the National Library in Prague. Results: We identified 7 studies (four experimental studies, two review studies and one quantitative-exploratory study) and included them in our study. The simulation process is considered a highly effective teaching method, which benefits the students, lecturers, and the faculty. Conclusions: The simulation process is one of the modern techniques of teaching nursing. The mentioned results indicate a high level of teaching effectiveness using this method. In all registered cases, the simulation strategy is assessed as more effective than other methods used so far, such as frontal teaching, video demonstrations, or simple demonstrations. © 2022 The Authors.","Academic environment; Education; Effectiveness assessment; Simulation; Teaching nursing","","","","","","","","Aslam S, Emmanuel P, Formulating a researchable question: A critical step for facilitating good clinical research, Indian J Sex Transm Dis AIDS, 31, 1, pp. 47-50, (2010); Banks S, Stanley MJ, Brown S, Matthew W, Simulation-Based Interprofessional Education: A Nursing and Social Work Collaboration, J Nurs Educ, 58, 2, pp. 110-113, (2019); Benner P, From Novice to Expert, Am J Nurs, 82, 3, pp. 402-407, (1982); Calleja JL, Soublette Sanchez A, Radedek Soto P, Is clinical simulation an effective learning tool in teaching clinical ethics?, Medwave, 20, 2, (2020); Cason ML, Gilbert GE, Schmoll HH, Dolinar SM, Anderson J, Nickles BM, Et al., Cooperative Learning Using Simulation to Achieve Mastery of Nasogastric Tube Insertion, J Nurs Educ, 54, 3, pp. S47-S51, (2015); Colicchia C, Strozzi F, Supply chain risk management: a new methodology for a systematic literature review, Int J Supply Chain Manag, 17, 4, pp. 403-418, (2012); Cukljek S, Juresa V, Ledinski Ficko S, Hosnjak AM, Smrekar M, Changes in attitudes of full-time and part-time nursing students in Croatia on nursing during their education, Cent Eur J Nurs Midw, 10, 1, pp. 977-985, (2019); Cunningham S, Foote L, Sowder M, Cunningham C, Interprofessional education and collaboration: A simulation-based learning experience focused on common and complementary skills in an acute care environment, J Interprof Care, 32, 3, pp. 395-398, (2018); Garrett-Wright D, Haughtigan K, Link K, Interactive Poverty Simulation.

The widespread adoption of 5G technology has pushed online learning even further into the mainstream. However, because online teaching does not have the drawback of being intuitive like classroom teaching, teachers' assessments of students' learning situations are less accurate. As a result, how to effectively evaluate students' academic performance in the context of 5G wireless network technology is a pressing issue that must be investigated. By processing these heterogeneous large-scale learning records and integrating multiple perspectives to analyze this learning record information to identify students' learning behaviors, this study proposes an integrated analysis algorithm based on artificial intelligence information technology. The possible learning outcomes of students are predicted based on their current learning situation, so teachers can provide auxiliary teaching strategies to students who may have learning difficulties based on the predicted information. The method proposed in this article uses information technology to predict students' grades, and the analysis shows that the method is very effective. In this article, different grades of classification methods are used to analyze and predict the whole students. All grade classification methods are effective in describing decision rules. No matter what grades classification method is used, the error rate of students' grades distribution is predicted to be below 40%.  © 2022 Yushu Guan.","","Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Knowledge;

This has led to a rise in the use of altmetrics, which are metrics based on social media data, news pieces, blogs, and more. Here we examine altmetric data linked to nearly 10,000 papers published in 23 conservation journals, exploring five issues that represent some of the challenges associated with using social media data in evaluating conservation. We discuss whether social media activity reflects meaningful engagement, and how easily individuals can manipulate scores by using bots or simply through active personal networks or institutional promotion services. Our analysis shows a highly skewed distribution of altmetric scores where most papers have such low scores that the scores likely convey little meaningful information. Examining scores that would be considered meritorious, we find that papers where the first author was male have higher scores than papers led by a woman, suggesting a gender bias in altmetric scores. Finally, this data set reveals regional differences that correspond with access to different social media platforms. Metrics, like altmetrics, may have a role to play when making rapid evaluations. However, such metrics should only be used after careful deliberation and should not be influenced by institutions looking for shortcuts, by companies looking to advance profits, or by individuals seeking to promote themselves, rather than generating meaningful engagement in scholarship and conservation action. Scholarly and conservation activities should be judged on the quality of their contributions, which will require the input of experts and direct contact with impacted communities. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

To assess the effects of a novel integrative educational curriculum for residents by examining results from the otolaryngology training examination (OTE). We hypothesized that altering the current curriculum to accentuate resident participation would result in improved performance on the OTE. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: We conducted a study from June 2015 to July 2018. All faculty attendings and residents were asked to participate in the study and were included. A novel educational curriculum founded on the principles of experiential learning and utilizing the PulseQD app to facilitate collaborative learning was implemented. The results of a questionnaire distributed within the department and yearly OTE scores were collected. Results: Residents and faculty attendings reported comparable exposure to educational formats throughout their training, although residents had more experience with flipped classroom settings. Both groups had similar attitudes toward the importance and effectiveness of educational opportunities. There was a statistically significant improvement in OTE scores in each of the 2 years after implementation of the educational changes (P =.0296 and P =.00237, respectively), with all current residents improving their scores on the most recent OTE. Conclusions: Through implementation of this integrative educational curriculum our residents showed significant improvement in OTE scores. Our results suggest that this type of curriculum, which combines a variety of approaches including a flipped classroom model with active participation and integrates app technology, can improve resident performance on educational assessments.

However, in the digital age, the survival environment of puppetry has been strongly impacted by digital media, and its inheritance and development face enormous challenges. Meanwhile, the use of serious games (SG) in education and culture and their teaching effectiveness are widely recognized. Therefore, this paper aims to help such intangible cultural heritage to achieve effective digital inheritance and cultural dissemination among young people by combining puppetry with serious games. This study first conducted a literature review to summarize the commonly used Octalysis framework in serious game design. Based on this analysis framework, the subsequent research focused on the design strategies for puppetry serious games. Firstly, extensive user interviews and surveys were conducted to obtain young people's design expectations for puppetry serious games, and KJ method was used to preliminarily summarize the user needs. Secondly, using the eight-aspect model analysis framework as the research dimension, the preliminary design requirements were further classified into design demand indicators, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to analyze the weight of the requirements and rank them. Finally, the design strategies for puppetry serious games were deduced based on the weight of the requirements, providing valuable design ideas for the inheritance and development of puppetry and a reference for the digital dissemination of traditional culture. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; Octalysis Framework; Puppetry; Serious Games","Digital storage; Game design; Serious games; Analysis frameworks; Cultural heritages; Design strategies; Digital age; Intangible cultural heritages; Octalyse framework; Puppetry; Survival environment; Teaching effectiveness; Young peoples; Analytic hierarchy process","","","","","","","Lee C.W., Oh S.H., A study on design factors of serious game considering senior layer, Proceedings of the 10Th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (Ictc)-Ict Convergence Leading the Autonomous Future, Jeju, South Korea, 16–18 Oct.

Particularly in the education domain, where dealing with and processing students’ opinions is a complicated task due to the nature of the language used by students and the large volume of information, the application of sentiment analysis is growing yet remains challenging. Several literature reviews reveal the state of the application of sentiment analysis in this domain from different perspectives and contexts. However, the body of literature is lacking a review that systematically classifies the research and results of the application of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) solutions for sentiment analysis in the education domain. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping study to structure the published information available. We used a stepwise PRISMA framework to guide the search process and searched for studies conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the electronic research databases of the scientific literature. We identified 92 relevant studies out of 612 that were initially found on the sentiment analysis of students’ feedback in learning platform environments. The mapping results showed that, despite the identified challenges, the field is rapidly growing, especially regarding the application of DL, which is the most recent trend. We identified various aspects that need to be considered in order to contribute to the maturity of research and development in the field. Among these aspects, we highlighted the need of having structured datasets, standardized solutions and increased focus on emotional expression and detection. © 2021 by the authors.

Combined with genetic algorithm, through the investigation, the evaluation process of multimedia teaching in colleges and the status quo of multimedia teaching were analyzed. Many teachers were interviewed. A set of evaluation indicators suitable for college multimedia teaching quality was discussed, and the indicators were visually displayed with data. From the aspects of multimedia courseware, multimedia classroom teaching process and multimedia teaching effect, teachers' basic information, students' basic information and evaluation relationship management are analyzed. The teaching quality evaluation system of college multimedia was designed and the results were tested. The research results showed that the evaluation of teaching quality was realized through the teaching evaluation system. Therefore, the system is of great significance to improve the effectiveness of classroom teaching. © 2019 IEEE.","evaluation index; evaluation system; genetic algorithm; multimedia; quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm; social computing; Teaching quality","Data visualization; Genetic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Students; Teaching; Evaluation index; evaluation system; multimedia; Quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm; Social computing; Teaching quality; Quality control","","","","","","","Larson M., Soleymani M., Ionescu B., Jones G.J.F., Gravier G., The benchmarking initiative for multimedia evaluation: Media eval 2016, IEEE Multimedia, 24, 1, pp. 93-96, (2017); Vazquez J.J., Chiang E.P., Preparing students for class: A clinical trial testing the efficacy between multimedia pre-lectures and textbooks in an economics course, J.

There are many related studies on factors affecting students’ participation, most of which are around external factors, while studies on internal factors are fewer. Spiral of Silence (SOS) theory can be applied for explaining the factors affecting people engage in public discussion, and this study apply extended SOS framework for analyzing psychological factors that affect students’ participation willingness and outspoken willingness in face-to-face discussion and online synchronous discussion. The result shows that communication apprehension can significantly hinder participation, and fear of isolation can significantly reduce outspokenness willingness.

This study aims to test the efficacy for educational purposes by evaluating the videos published on YouTube (www.youtube.com) channel for low anterior resection procedure in rectum surgery. Methods: We searched YouTube on October 17, 2020 to choose video clips that included relevant information about laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer. Results: We included 25 academics and 75 individual videos in this study. The teaching quality of the videos was evaluated according to academic and individual videos, and it was seen that the teaching quality scores of academic videos were higher and this result was statistically significant (P =.03). The modified Laparoscopic Surgery Video Educational Guidelines (LAP-VEGaS) criteria were found that the score was higher in individual videos (P =.014). The median Video Power Index (VPI) value was 1.50 (range.05-347) and the mean ratio was 7.01 ± 3.52. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (P =.443). Discussion: Video-based surgical learning is an effective method for surgical education. Our study showed that the video quality and educational content of most of the videos about the low anterior resection procedure on YouTube were low. The videos of academic origin seem more valuable than individual videos. As far as video popularity is concerned, YouTube viewers are not selective. For this reason, training videos to be used for educational purposes must be passed through a standardized evaluation filter. © The Author(s) 2021.","educational value; laparoscopic low anterior resection; laparoscopic surgery video educational guidelines; YouTube","Humans; Laparoscopy; Proctectomy; Reproducibility of Results; Social Media; Video Recording; academic video; Article; checklist; education; educational value; human; individual video; laparoscopic low anterior resection; Likert scale; modified laparoscopic surgery video educational guidelines criteria; physical parameters; rectum anterior resection; rectum cancer; social media; teaching quality; video clips; video power index; videorecording; education; laparoscopy; rectum resection; reproducibility; videorecording","","","","","","","Cancer Facts Figures 2019, (2019); Lacy A.M., Garcia-Valdecasas J.C., Delgado S., Et al., Laparoscopy-assisted colectomy versus open colectomy for treatment of non-metastatic colon cancer: a randomised trial, Lancet, 359, 9325, pp. 2224-2229, (2002); Glynne-Jones R., Wyrwicz L., Tiret E., Et al., Rectal cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, Ann Oncol, 28, 4, pp. 22-40, (2017); Nelson H., Sargent D.J., Wieand H.S., Et al., (Clinical outcomes of surgical therapy study group).

Rd., Wufeng Dist., Taichung City, 413310, Taiwan","Effective oral presentation skill is vital for a college student's success in educational, social, and professional life. There is a great deal of research interest focusing on English speaking performance and yet there are relatively few studies suggesting effective teaching approaches how instructors cope with the restrictions in current classroom settings to enhance English as a foreign (EFL) college students' English Speech performance and motivation. The utilization of videotaped peer evaluation is recognized as having significant pedagogic value and has gained much attention in recent years due to the increasing emphasis on learner self-regulation and the rapid development of advanced social networking technology (SNT). Instructors in a number of universities have tried out videotaped peer evaluation in online collaborative team projects to evaluate student contributions to both process and task. This current study was designed to (1) investigate if the EFL college students were competent in evaluating their peers' oral performance alongside their instructor in English Speech class, and (2) to explore EFL college students' perceptions and attitudes towards the incorporation of videotaped peer evaluation and the potential of Social Networking Technology as academic learning tool in English Speech Class. Ninety-two junior English majors enrolled in English Speech courses were recruited to participate in this study. Data was collected via video recording of students' oral presentations, students' videotaped peer feedback, students' English speech evaluations forms. A questionnaire-based survey was also administrated to better understand and measure students' perceptions towards the videotaped peer evaluation and the academic use of Social Networking Technology in English Speech Class. Some statistical analyses were employed. The researcher first compared the means and standard deviations of the instructor and videotaped peer evaluations to determine the levels of agreement between the two sets of marks of the individual speech. Next, independent t-tests were conducted to examine if there were any significant differences between the instructor and videotaped peer evaluation of English speech performance. Then, the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were computed to test the relationship between instructor- A nd videotaped peer-evaluation. Finally, descriptive statistical analysis was carried out to analyze EFL college students' view on videotaped peer evaluation and social networking sites as instructional tool for English Speech. The results revealed that the videotaped peer evaluation was similar to the instructor's assessment. Students' competencies in peer evaluation appear to be independent on the oral performance. Students held a positive orientation toward implementing videotaped peer evaluation through social networking technology and agreed on the positive impact of videotaped peer evaluation on the use of appropriate organizational pattern, pronunciation, body languages, confidence, and eye contact. The results provide preliminary evidence that the instructor's evaluation can be supplemented with videotaped peer evaluation and practical implications for the implementation of SNT in EFL English Speech class.  © 2021 ACM.","E-learning Self-regulation; Educational technology; English Speech; Social Networking Technology (SNT); Videotaped Peer Evaluation","E-learning; Economic and social effects; Electronic commerce; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Speech; Statistical methods; Surveys; Technical presentations; Video recording; Collaborative teams; Instructional tool; Organizational pattern; Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient; Research interests; Social networking sites; Social networking technologies; Standard deviation; Students","","","","","","","Barkley E.F., Cross K.P., Major C.H., Collaborative Learning Techniques: A Handbook for College Faculty, (2005); Brick B., How effective are Web 2.0 language learning sites in facilitating language learning, Compass: Journal of Learning and Teaching, 2, pp. 57-63, (2011); Cheng W., Warren M., Peer and teacher assessment of the oral and written tasks of a group project, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 24, pp. 301-314, (1999); Cohen L.C., Spenciner L.J., Assessment of Children and Youth with Special Needs (3rd Ed.), (2007); Falchikov N., Goldfinch J., Student peer assessment in higher education: A meta-analysis comparing peer and teacher marks, Review of Educational Research, 70, 3, pp. 287-322, (2000); Greenan K., Humphreys P., McIlveen H., Developing transferable personal skills: Part of the graduate toolkit, Education & Training, 39, pp. 71-78, (1997); Holroyd C., Are assessors professional Student assessment and the professionalism of academics, Active Learning in Higher Education, 1, pp. 28-44, (2000); Hsu P.Y., Training college students to use self-monitoring strategies in English speech, Chaoyang Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 6, 1, pp. 1-18, (2008); Johnson D.W., Johnson R.T., Assessing Students in Groups: Promoting Group Responsibility and Individual Accountability, (2004); Johnson C.B., Smith F.I., Assessment of a complex peer evaluation instrument for team learning and group processes, Accounting Education, 2, pp. 21-41, (1997); Kabilan M.K., Ahmad N., Abidin M.J.Z., Facebook: An online environmentfor learning of English in institutions of higher education, Internet and Higher Education, 13, pp. 179-187, (2010); Kwan K.P., Leung R., Tutor versus peer group assessment of student performance in a simulation exercise, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 21, 3, pp. 205-214, (1996); Lisk A.R., Using Teams to Enhance Learning in Management Education, (2000); MacLntyre P.D., Noels K.A., Clement R., Biases in Self-Ratings of Second Language Proficiency: The Role of Language Anxiety, Language Learning, pp. 265-287, (2002); May G.L., The effect of rater training on reducing social style bias in peer evaluation, Business Communication Quarterly, 71, 3, pp. 297-313, (2008); Manasijevi D., Zivkovi D., Arsi S., Milosevic I., Exploring students' purposes of usage and educational usage of Facebook, Computers in Human Behavior, 60, pp. 441-450, (2016); Omelicheva M.Y., Self and peer evaluation in undergraduate education: Structuring conditions that maximize its promises and minimize the perils, Journal of Political Science Education, 1, pp. 191-205, (2005); Pond K., Ul-Haq R., Learning to assess students using peer review, Studies in Educational Evaluation, 23, 4, pp. 331-348, (1997); Saavedra R., Kwun S.K., Peer evaluation in self managing work groups, Journal of Applied Psychology, 78, 3, pp. 450-462, (1993); Topping K., Peer assessment between students in colleges and universities, Review of Educational Research, 6, pp. 249-276, (1998); Yang M., Badger R., Yu Z., A comparative study of peer and teacher feedback in a Chinese EFL writing class, Journal of Second Language Writing, 15, 3, pp. 179-200, (2006); Zimmerman B.J., Attaining Self-Regulation: A Social Cognitive Perspective, Handbook of Self-Regulation, (2000)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","12th International Conference on E-Education, E-Business, E-Management, and E-Learning, IC4E 2021","10 January 2021 through 13 January 2021","Virtual, Online","169547","","978-145038854-2","","","English","ACM Int.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are regarded as the most intriguing and often discussed issues in the study of educational innovation in recent years across all different types of learning platforms. New knowledge is presented in MOOCs and may be acquired through teamwork, communication, and the development of online communities by the participants. Although MOOCs are widely utilized in Indonesia, their users are still not at their best. The use of MOOCs for learning is still appealing and efficient, despite the diverse opinions on their usage in Indonesia. It is vital to plan and create a bigger MOOC because of this. Additionally, the use of MOOCs in high school Indonesian language instruction. The purpose of this project is to create and develop MOOC-based instructional materials for eleven grade senior high schools that teach Indonesian. A 4D Thiagarajan research design is used in this study. The ILMOO prototype may always be improved according to its research design, even after the validation step. The steps of define, design, develop, and distribute are where the study begins. The findings indicated that ILMOO (Indonesian Language MOOC for High School), an Indonesian language MOOC at the high school level, could be utilized as a student and teacher assessment of ILMOO, and the attainment of learning indicators by using ILMOO became the subject of additional study.  © 2022 ACM.","high school; Indonesian language learning; MOOC design and development","E-learning; Course design; Course development; Design and Development; Higher School; Indonesia; Indonesian language learning; Indonesian languages; Massive open online course; Massive open online course design and development; Research designs; High level languages","","","","","","","Nur Amalia M., Kusuma Zamahsari G., Meidian Pratama P., 2021 MOOCs in Foreign Language Learning: A Review of Development Strategies, Benefits, and User Perspectives, 2021 7th International Conference on Education and Technology (ICET, pp. 147-151; Anders A., 2015 Theories and applications of massive online open courses (MOOCs): The case for hybrid design, International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 16, 6, pp. 39-61, (2015); Wahyu Anggraeni C., 2019 Engaged Learning in MOOCs for Teaching Professional Development in the Cyber Era: A Study of Autoethnography, ELLiC 2019, (2019); Aziz A., 2018 Evaluating the design standard of UiTM massive open online courses, International Journal of Education and Literacy Studies, 6, 4, pp. 138-151, (2018); Bartoletti R., 2016 Learning through design: MOOC development as a method for exploring teaching methods, Current Issues in Emerging ELearning, 3, 1, (2016); Bralic A., Divjak B., Use of MOOCs in traditional classroom: Blended learning approach, EDEN Conference Proceedings, pp. 34-43, (2016); Chacon-Beltran R., Massive online open courses and language learning: The case for a beginners?

The traditional face-to-face learning mode has been switched to online (distance) learning, causing various influences on students' academic performance. As higher education plays a central role in technology innovation and society development, it is of great importance to investigate and improve online education in the context of COVID-19. This study distributed online questionnaires to college students from 30 provinces or municipalities in China to evaluates the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) factors of shifting from traditional learning to online learning during COVID-19 Pandemic. The SWOT analysis has been employed to construct 16 kind of internal and external evaluation factors and 4 kind of improvement strategies for assess online education. The basic data of subjective weight method - AHP comes from the questionnaire survey, and the weight value of SWOT factors are determined through the questionnaire survey results. The fuzzy MARCOS approach is used to select the most suitable strategies for its effective implementation. Several coping strategies are suggested to improve the online education in post-pandemic era, which is essential for higher education and promoting a civilized and sustainable society. 'By reforming and innovating the teacher led teaching mode, stimulate students' interest in learning, get rid of the boring learning state, create a good learning atmosphere and improve the teaching quality' is the most effective strategy to enhance the online learning experience and increase students' satisfaction. This methodology is applicable with a case study concerning the students' online education in pandemic and the validity of this approach is presented through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through example verification, it is found that SWOT method is suitable for online education evaluation research no matter how the research object changes.  © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19 pandemic; fuzzy AHP; fuzzy MARCOS; online education; SWOT analysis","Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Hierarchical systems; Online systems; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Students; Surveys; Teaching; COVID-19 pandemic; Distance-learning; Electronic learning; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy MARCOS; Mobile Learning; On-line education; Pandemic; Psychology; Social networking (online); Strength analysis; Threats analysis; COVID-19","","","","","","","Chang J.Y.-F., Wang L.-H., Lin T.-C., Cheng F.-C., Chiang C.-P., Comparison of learning effectiveness between physical classroom and online learning for dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic, J.

It is probably a state of mental turmoil of fear, novelty and anxiety among the faculty. This state is likely to affect teaching performance, learning and also have implications for the health of the faculty. Objectives: To assess the fear of COVID-19 and its impact on the quality of life during the Lockdown situation among the teaching faculty of a Health University and also study the gender differences if any. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the teaching faculty of a Health University during April 28 through to May 8, 2020. Randomly selected 270 faculty were sent Google link of the assessment tool using the University e-mail network. They had to fill the questionnaire based on their experience of the past 1 month. Assessment tools used were fear scale of COVID-19 and adapted with permission World Health Organization quality of life (QOL)-BREF QoL. Results: Out of the 270 participants, only 198 teaching faculty participated in the survey (response rate = 73.33%). The overall mean fear score was 18.69 ± 5.57 and the overall QoL mean score was 46.29 ± 4.02. There was a gender-wise statistically significant difference observed in the fear score (t = 2.34, P = 0.02), reporting more fear in the females (19.45 ± 5.81) as compared to the males (17.57 ± 5.01). There was a negative correlation between QoL scores and Fear score r = -0.24 (P = 0.000). Conclusions: There is certainly a fear about COVID-19, but it has not impacted the quality of life. © 2021 Medical Journal of Dr. D.Y.

Currently, sentiment analysis technology is developing rapidly, but its application in the educational field is lagging. Most of the research is based on sentiment analysis of published texts on social media or videos recorded by students, which may lead to problems such as incomplete feedback content and delayed feedback analysis. Based on the mini-Xception framework, this paper implements the real-time identification and analysis of student sentiment in classroom teaching. Through the feedback results, teachers can fully understand the degree of student engagement and provide reasonable suggestions for subsequent teaching progress. The experimental results show that this method has high recognition accuracy for the real-time detection of seven student sentiments, and the average accuracy is 76.71 %. Compared with after-class student feedback or real-time text sentiment analysis, it can better reflect the real time and high efficiency of information feedback. It provides a basis for teachers to control the teaching rhythm and evaluate the teaching effect and is an effective method for realizing personalized teaching.  © 2021 IEEE.","personalized teaching; real-time; sentiment analysis; student feedback","Feedback; Students; Classroom teaching; Education field; In-depth application; In-depth understanding; Personalized teaching; Real- time; Sentiment analysis; Student feedback; Teachers'; Teaching-learning; Sentiment analysis","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61762023, 62166008)","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by the Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 61762023 and Grant 62166008.","Lu W., Jin Y., The analysis on application effect of a provincial modern distance education management information system, International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine & Education, (2016); Zhuo L., Geng Q.X., The application of hybrid flipped classroom in the course of Java programming, International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine & Education, (2016); Ming C., Dan T., The multimedia technology application in the network distance education-accountancy as a model, 2015 7th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, (2015); Andrade A., Delandshere G., Danish J.A., Using multimodal learning analytics to model student behaviour: A systematic analysis of behavioural framing, Journal of Learning Analytics, 3, pp. 282-306, (2016); Liu H., Ma S., Xia D., Li S., Sfanet: A spectrum-aware feature augmentation network for visible-infrared person reidentification, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 14, pp. 1-14, (2021); Umar M., Ahmad N.B., Zainal A., Sentiment analysis of student's opinion on programming assessment: Evaluation of nave bayes over support vector machines, International Journal of Innovative Computing, 10, pp. 51-58, (2020); Zhao Z., Zhu H., Xue Z., Liu Z., Liu M., An image-text consistency driven multimodal sentiment analysis approach for social media, Information Processing & Management, 56, (2019); Nair L.R., Shetty S.D., Shetty S.D., Streaming big data analysis for real-time sentiment based targeted advertising, International Journal of Electrical & Computer Engineering, 7, pp. 402-407, (2017); Kim C.M., Kim K.H., Lee Y.S., Chung K., Park R.C., Real-time streaming image based pp2lfa-crnn model for facial sentiment analysis, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 199586-199602, (2020); Grazulevicius G., Barzdenas V., Vasjanov A., Liobe J., Applying smart devices for gathering real-time feedback from students, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 29, pp. 613-623, (2020); Lin K.C., Huang T.-C., Hung J.C., Yen N.Y., Chen S.J., Facial emotion recognition towards affective computing-based learning, Library Hi Tech, 31, pp. 294-307, (2013); Chollet F., Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, (2017); Arriaga O., Valdenegro-Toro M., Plger P., Real-time convolutional neural networks for emotion and gender classification, The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, (2017); Li H., Zhe L., Shen X., Brandt J., Gang H., A convolutional neural network cascade for face detection, Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition, (2015); Chauhan G.S., Agrawal P., Meena Y.K., Aspect-based sentiment analysis of students' feedback to improve teaching-learning process, Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems, 107, pp. 259-266, (2019); Viola P., Jones M.J., Robust real-time face detection, International Journal of Computer Vision, 57, pp. 137-154, (2004); Jyoti S., Sharma G., Dhall A., Expression empowered residen network for facial action unit detection, 2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, (2019); Zhang S., Zhu X., Lei Z., Shi H., Wang X., Li S.Z., Faceboxes: A cpu real-time face detector with high accuracy, International Joint Conference on Biometrics, (2017); Lominadze A., Real-time expression analysis of students in a classroom using facial emotion recognition, (2020)","D.

One of them is in educational institutions. The application of New Normal with its social distancing has made learning carried out remotely. The implementation of distance learning in schools needs an innovation through the use of Information and Communication Technology in learning. There are several Information and Communication Technology media that can be used in learning including computers and the internet. Teachers can design subject matter using computers. Then the material that has been designed is delivered to students via the internet network. Currently, there are many social media that support distance learning. SDIT Cahaya Hati has also conducted distance learning. Teachers need to prepare distance learning material in advance before it is delivered to students. This study aims to reveal the use of Information and Communication Technology by SDIT Cahaya Hati teachers in distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The type of this research is qualitative with interview data collection techniques, and documentation. The results show that the Cahaya Hati SDIT teachers have organized distance learning using Information and Communication Technology media. SDIT Cahaya Hati teachers use computers to make learning materials in the form of power points and learning videos. This material is delivered to students using the internet network through a WhatsApp group.

However, concerns arouse when the result of SET and students' final grades are highly positively correlated, which means the students may make the evaluation based on the final grades they take. For the purpose of avoiding retaliation and mutual reward rating, some methods based on statistics or rules are used to detect the presence of anomaly evaluation. Whereas, the problem is still challenging since the characteristics of this abnormal evaluation are implicit and multimodal. Besides, additional information such as the domain of subject, instructors' teaching style, and the reputation spread by students also requires corresponding prior knowledge to supplement the abnormal evaluation detection model. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a multimodal embedding and prior knowledge based neural network to detect potential so called Interest Factor Influenced Abnormal Evaluation (IFAE). The method proposed in this paper uses SDNE and PV-DM to embed the evaluation network between students and teachers and the comment text of students. Taking into account the continuity of mutual evaluation between students and teachers during the teaching cycles and the different emphasis of students' comment texts on teachers, the features of students and teachers are comprehensively constructed. Then, the attention mechanism is used in the comment text to perform final prediction jointly with above features. The experiment result shows that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-art models which based on single type of features on F1 score by 9.25%. © 2019 IEEE.","Abnormal evaluation detection; Fusion of multimodal feature; Interest factor influenced abnormal evaluation; Priori knowledge; Student evaluation of teaching","Big data; Cloud computing; Embeddings; Knowledge based systems; Neural networks; Social networking (online); Attention mechanisms; Detection models; Multi-modal; Mutual evaluations; Prior knowledge; Priori knowledge; Student evaluation; Teaching styles; Students","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61371194); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2012CB720700, 2013CB329303); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","The authors would to thank the academic affairs Office of Minnan Normal University for accessing their student evaluation of teaching database.

However, numerous studies have questioned the effectiveness of these less engaging educational strategies. Studies outside of CME suggest that engaged learning is associated with improved educational outcomes. However, measuring participants’ engagement can be challenging. We developed and determined the validity evidence for a novel instrument to assess learner engagement in CME. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional validation study at a large, didactic-style CME conference. Content validity evidence was established through review of literature and previously published engagement scales and conceptual frameworks on engagement, along with an iterative process involving experts in the field, to develop an eight-item Learner Engagement Instrument (LEI). Response process validity was established by vetting LEI items on item clarity and perceived meaning prior to implementation, as well as using a well-developed online platform with clear instructions. Internal structure validity evidence was based on factor analysis and calculating internal consistency reliability. Relations to other variables validity evidence was determined by examining associations between LEI and previously validated CME Teaching Effectiveness (CMETE) instrument scores. Following each presentation, all participants were invited to complete the LEI and the CMETE. Results: 51 out of 206 participants completed the LEI and CMETE (response rate 25%) Correlations between the LEI and the CMETE overall scores were strong (r = 0.80). Internal consistency reliability for the LEI was excellent (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.96). To support validity to internal structure, a factor analysis was performed and revealed a two dimensional instrument consisting of internal and external engagement domains. The internal consistency reliabilities were 0.96 for the internal engagement domain and 0.95 for the external engagement domain. Conclusion: Engagement, as measured by the LEI, is strongly related to teaching effectiveness. The LEI is supported by robust validity evidence including content, response process, internal structure, and relations to other variables. Given the relationship between learner engagement and teaching effectiveness, identifying more engaging and interactive methods for teaching in CME is recommended. © 2020, The Author(s).","CME; Engagement; Teaching effectiveness; Validity","Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Medical, Continuing; Humans; Learning; Reproducibility of Results; Students; cross-sectional study; human; learning; medical education; reproducibility; student","","","","","","","Cervero R.M., Gaines J.K., The impact of CME on physician performance and patient health outcomes: an updated synthesis of systematic reviews, J Contin Educ Health Prof, 35, pp. 131-138, (2015); Warden G.L., Mazmanian P.E., Leach D.C., Redesigning continuing education in the health professions, (2010); Nissen S.E., Reforming the continuing medical education system, Jama., 313, pp. 1813-1814, (2015); Campbell E.G., Rosenthal M., Reform of continuing medical education: investments in physician human capital, JAMA., 302, pp. 1807-1808, (2009); Davis D.A., Prescott J., Fordis C.M., Et al., Rethinking CME: an imperative for academic medicine and faculty development, Acad Med, 86, pp. 468-473, (2011); Mazmanian P.E., Davis D.A., Continuing medical education and the physician as a learner: guide to the evidence, Jama., 288, pp. 1057-1060, (2002); Stephenson C.R., Wang A.T., Szostek J.H., Et al., Flipping the continuing medical education classroom: validating a measure of attendees' perceptions, J Contin Educ Health Prof, 36, pp. 256-262, (2016); Bloom B.S., Effects of continuing medical education on improving physician clinical care and patient health: a review of systematic reviews, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 21, pp. 380-385, (2005); Michael J., Where's the evidence that active learning works?, Adv Physiol Educ, 30, pp. 159-167, (2006); Prober C.G., Heath C., Lecture halls without lectures—a proposal for medical education, N Engl J Med, 366, pp. 1657-1659, (2012); Bernard J.S., Student engagement: a principle-based concept analysis, Int J Nurs Educ Scholarsh, 12, pp. 111-121, (2015); Astin A.W., Student involvement: a developmental theory for higher education, J Coll Stud Pers, 25, pp. 297-308, (1984); Burch G.F., Heller N.A., Burch J.J., Freed R., Steed S.A., Student engagement: developing a conceptual framework and survey instrument, J Educ Bus, 90, pp. 224-229, (2015); Gunuc S., Kuzu A., Student engagement scale: development, reliability and validity, Assess Eval High Educ, 40, pp. 587-610, (2015); Williams R.L., Eggert A.C., Notetaking in college classes: student patterns and instructional strategies, J Gen Educ, 51, 3, pp. 173-199, (2002); Kiewra K.A., A review of note-taking: the encoding-storage paradigm and beyond, Educ Psychol Rev, 1, pp. 147-172, (1989); Crenshaw K., Curry W., Salanitro A.H., Et al., Is physician engagement with web-based CME associated with patients’ baseline hemoglobin A1c levels?

However, the complex, intensive, and noisy nature of process data makes it challenging to model with the traditional psychometric methods. Social network methods have been applied to visualize and analyze process data. Nonetheless, research about statistical modeling of process information using social network methods is still limited. This article explored the application of the latent space model (LSM) for analyzing process data in educational assessment. The adjacent matrix of transitions between actions was created based on the weighted and directed network of action sequences and related auxiliary information. Then, the adjacent matrix was modeled with LSM to identify the lower-dimensional latent positions of actions. Three applications based on the results from LSM were introduced: action clustering, error analysis, and performance measurement. The simulation study showed that LSM can cluster actions from the same problem-solving strategy and measure students’ performance by comparing their action sequences with the optimal strategy. Finally, we analyzed the empirical data from PISA 2012 as a real case scenario to illustrate how to use LSM. © 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.","","","","","","","","","Bennett R.E., Persky H., Weiss A.R., Jenkins F., Problem solving in technology-rich environments: A report from the NAEP technology-based assessment project, research and development series, NCES 2007–466, (2007);

It's sometimes referred to as “opinion mining” or “emotion extraction”. Sentiment Analysis is a growing area of study in text mining and a popular research subject for opinion mining in education, which analyses and comprehends students’ attitudes toward their learning in order to improve the quality of decision-making. More innovative approaches have been developed in online education, which provide an efficient way to learn irrespective of Gender, geographical discrimination, age, etc. As more and more reviews or feedback are posted during online classes, these messages should be correctly classified to identify the theme behind them. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based classification models are used to solve sentiment classification problems. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are most frequently used algorithms for Natural Language processing (NLP). It allows us to have a deeper understanding of the student’s emotions. It may also be used to recognize and analyse feelings in user comments or reviews on various blogs, websites, social media, online communities, and other sites in order to better understand their perspectives. Thus, the most addressed domain was the use of sentiment analysis in the context of higher education and the evaluation of teaching quality. It would be very helpful for instructors to improve learning strategies by assessing both the instructors and students’ progress. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Deep learning; Emotion extraction; Machine learning; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Opinion mining; Polarity; Sentimental analysis; Text mining","Convolutional neural networks; Data mining; Decision trees; E-learning; Education computing; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quality control; Recurrent neural networks; Social networking (online); Students; Support vector machines; Deep learning; Emotion extractions; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Opinion mining; Polarity; Sentimental analyse; Text-mining; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Almalki J.C., A machine learning-based approach for sentiment analysis on distance learning from Arabic Tweets, (2022); Altrabsheh N., Cocea M., Fallahkhair S., Learning sentiment from students’ feedback for real-time interventions in classrooms, ICAIS 2014.

This study included 22 high-quality peer-reviewed journal articles for the meta-analysis. The authors reveal that there are no significant differences in teaching effectiveness between the Twitter and non-Twitter-assisted learning approaches. Twitter-assisted learning outcomes are significantly higher than the non-Twitter-assisted whether Twitter is used as a supplementary or an integrated tool. Twitter-assisted learning can lead to significantly higher learning outcomes than non-Twitter-assisted learning in the USA, Greece, and Sweden, but no significant difference is revealed in Spain. Swedish users hold significantly positive attitudes towards the use of Twitter in education, but no significant difference is found in the USA. Twitter-assisted learning can cause significantly more engagement than non-Twitter-assisted in the USA, and male learners have significantly higher learning outcomes than females in both the USA and Spain. © 2022 Authors.

Firstly, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy value is used to represent the trust relationships between experts in the social network, and a trust q-rung orthopair fuzzy value is defined. Secondly, considering the decreasing and multipath of trust in the process of trust propagation, this study designs a trust propagation mechanism by using its multiplication operation in the q-ROFS environment and proposes a trust q-ROFS aggregation approach. Moreover, based on the trust scores and confidence levels of ex-perts, a new integration operator called q-rung orthopair fuzzy-induced ordered weighted average operator is proposed to fuse experts’ evaluation information. Additionally, considering the impact of consensus interaction on decision-making results, a consensus interaction model based on the q-ROF distance measure and trust relationship is proposed, including consistency measurement, identification of inconsistent expert decision-making opinions and a personalized adjustment mechanism. Finally, the SNGDM method is applied to solve the problem of evaluating online teaching quality. © 2021 by the authors.

It is specifically focusing on roles as educators, mentors, managers, and evaluators. The research used descriptive qualitative approach. Two ICT teachers and two conventional ones were taken as the subjects of the research using purposive sampling technique. The results of the research showed that (1) In educating role, both ICT and conventional teachers act as models who possess emphatic feeling towards their students and environment. If the conventional teachers teach students at boat class conventionally using printed modules, the ICT teachers make use of ICT applications such as Whatsapp beside the use of printed modules, (2) In mentoring role, conventional teachers display their patience and loyalty to provide unrestricted knowledge to students inside and outside the classroom whereas ICT teachers provide students with more flexible services using social media applications in discussing the student worksheet and giving feedback, (3) In managerial role, conventional teachers organize the class directly so that the class becomes quiet, convenient, and students do not disturb each other. Differently, ICT teachers manage the class virtually from planning to evaluation. The teaching materials and worksheet are not only given in printed modules but also uploaded online via Whatssapp. and (4) In evaluating role, onventional teachers evaluate the students' cognitive competence by using printed test. However, ICT teachers make use of technological aids in evaluating students' competence and skill. The test is made in google form and its link is sent to students so that the students can do it wherever and whenever they are available. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","And Coastal Students; Boat Class; Conventional Teacher; ICT Teacher","Boats; Education computing; Engineering education; Flexible displays; Managers; Coastal area; Comparative studies; Flexible service; Qualitative approach; Sampling technique; Social media; Teaching materials; Students","","","","","","","Claro M., Et al., Teaching in a Digital Environment (TIDE): Defining and measuring teachers' capacity to develop students' digital information and communication skills, Comput.

This digitalchemlab is a supplement to the already existing classical student laboratory. Digital media can be used to create an interesting and highly customised design of the lab day for each student. In a first research project, a digital learning module is designed. Learners are to select different tasks with optional learning aids along a differentiation matrix and switch flexibly between classic student lab aspects such as experimenting in the lab and digital tasks.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate home-based teaching quality via Network. Based on the analytic hierarchy process, this paper selects five indicators, i.e. learning users, teaching content, teaching methods, teaching platform and teaching effect, to build an evaluation system of online teaching effect and evaluate online teaching quality. It is shown that the impact of the home environment under the student user criterion module, the perfect teaching platform function under the teaching platform criterion module, and the student learning requirements under the student user criterion module have the most significant impact on the effect of online teaching in the evaluation system, while the basic knowledge is less influential. The evaluation system provides technical support for the evaluation of online teaching effects.  © 2020 IEEE.","Analytic Hierarchy Process; evaluation system; online teaching quality","Analytic hierarchy process; Information management; Learning systems; Quality control; Students; Home environment; Ministry of Education; Network teaching; Online platforms; Teaching contents; Teaching methods; Teaching platform; Technical support; E-learning","","","","","","","Notice of the Ministry OfEducation on the Issuance of The""Action Plan for Education Informatization 2; Bin D., High school mathematics classroom teaching quality evaluation based on AHP [J], Education Modernization, 2, pp. 51-54, (2019); Xinrui Z., Yuqing Z., Linyun Q., Zhihong Z., Construction of MOOC teaching quality evaluation index system of college physics based on AHP [J], Physics and Engineering, 115, pp. 1-54, (2018); Jian K., Yang H., Xiao L., Research on the Evaluation and Optimization Countermeasures of Network Teaching Information Ecosystem in Universities[J], 7, pp. 45-56, (2019); Nan S., Lijun X., Zilong W., Yinghong G., Evaluation analysis of network teaching effect based on AHP[J], Theoretical Research, 11, pp. 20-21, (2017)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2020 International Conference on Modern Education and Information Management, ICMEIM 2020","18 September 2020 through 20 September 2020","Changsha","168291","","978-172819623-7","","","English","Proc. - Int.

This leads us to wonder why this survey is applied only once and why it only asks about some factors. The objective of the article is to demonstrate the feasibility of a proposal to determine the degree of perception of student satisfaction through the use of data science and natural language processing (NLP), supported by the social network twitter, as an element of data collection. As a result of the application of this proposal based on data science, it was possible to determine the level of student satisfaction, being 57.27%, through sentiment analysis using the Python library ""NLTK""; Thus, it was also possible to extract texts linked to the relevant factors of teaching performance to achieve student satisfaction, through the term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach, these being those linked to the use of tools of simulation in the virtual learning process. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

The core idea of this paper is to map the connection between teaching practices to student learning in an online environment. Face to face evaluation techniques are fairly quick and easy for formative assessments to check student understanding in existent environment. Prevailing studies illustrate that a person's facial expressions and emotions are closely related. In order to make the teaching-learning process more effective, teachers usually collect day to day feedback from the students. This feedback can be used to improve teaching skills and make the process more interactive. In a virtual learning mode, there is a need to identify and understand the emotions of people. Constructive information can be extracted from online platforms using facial recognition algorithms. An online course connected with students is used for examination; the results have shown that this technique performs strongly.  © 2021 IEEE.","Emotion analysis; facial landmark points; lecture feedback; MTCNN; student involvement; teacher assessment","E-learning; Face recognition; Education systems; Emotion analysis; Facial landmark; Facial landmark point; Lecture feedback; MTCNN; On-line education; Student emotions; Student involvements; Teacher assessments; Students","","","","","","","Wang W., Xu K., Niu H., Miao X., Emotion recognition of students based on facial expressions in online education based on the perspective of computer simulation, Hindawi Complexity, 2020, pp. 1-9, (2020); Darwin C., Prodger P., The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, (1998); Tian Y.-I., Kanade T., Cohn J.F., Recognizing action units for facial expression analysis, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 23, 2, pp. 97-115, (2001); Goodfellow J., Erhan D., Carrier P.L., Et al., Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests, Neural Information Processing, pp. 117-124, (2013); Zeng Z., Pantic M., Roisman G.I., Huang T.S., A survey of affect recognition methods: Audio, visual, and spontaneous expressions, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31, 1, pp. 39-58, (2009); Sariyanidi E., Gunes H., Cavallaro A., Automatic analysis of facial affect: A survey of registration, representation, and Complexity 7 recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37, 6, pp. 1113-1133, (2015); Martinez B., Valstar M.F., Advances, challenges, and opportunities in automatic facial expression recognition, Advances in Face Detection and Facial Image Analysis, pp. 63-100, (2016); Devi Burri R., Manvitha Enadula S., Devi Odugu R., Prasad V.B.V.N., Decision making for common stock selection using Regression Techniques, Test Engineering and Management, 83, (2020); Gunes H., Schuller B., Categorical and dimensional affect analysis in continuous input: Current trends and future directions, Image and Vision Computing, 31, 2, pp. 120-136, (2013); Li S., Deng W., Deep facial expression recognition: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing; Wang M., Deng W., Deep Face Recognition: A Survey; Devi Burri R., Burri R., Reddy Bojja R., Buraga S., Insurance claim analysis using machine learning algorithms, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 8, 6 S4, (2019); Lin J., Zhou T., Chen Z., DeepIR: A Deep Semantics Driven Framework for Image Retargeting; Zhang K., Zhang Z., Li Z., Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks; Devi Burri R., Madhuri A., Sai Raghavendra D.N., A multi resolution convolution neural network based face recognition analysis, Journal of Critical Reviews, 7, 18, (2020); Triantafyllidou D., Tefas A., A fast deep convolutional neural network for face detection in big visual data, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, (2017); Zeng Z., Pantic M., Roisman G.I., Huang T.S., A survey of affect recognition methods: Audio, visual, and spontaneous expressions, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis AndMachine Intelligence, 31, 1, pp. 39-58, (2009); Sariyanidi E., Gunes H., Cavallaro A., Automatic analysis of facial affect: A survey of registration, representation, and Complexity 7 recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37, 6, pp. 1113-1133, (2015); Zhang N., Gao W., Luo J., Research on face detection technology based on MTCNN, 2020 International Conference on Computer Network, Electronic and Automation (ICCNEA)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","4th International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies, ICECCT 2021","15 September 2021 through 17 September 2021","Erode","175062","","978-166541480-7","","","English","Int.

Drawing on three years of social network data in three districts, we find that administrators were more likely to be talking together about teacher evaluation than the Common Core. Further, administrators with more positive views of the potential impact of these policies and their access to the human and technical resources necessary for implementation were more likely to engage in positive information seeking behaviors. These findings have important implications for policies intended to increase instructional coherence in schools and districts. © 2021, Arizona State University.

The application of SPOCS guidance mode in international trade practice teaching will help stimulate students' interest in knowledge, improve classroom-teaching effect, and improve classroom teaching quality. In order to fully mobilize students' subjective initiative and creativity, we should cultivate students into new talents with strong comprehensive quality. Let students study actively and autonomously under the correct guidance of teachers. From the perspective of ""1 + x""certificate system, this paper introduces the necessity of developing application-oriented undergraduate education. This paper expounds the requirements of the ""1 + x""certificate system for the classroom teaching of applied economics and analyzes the problems existing in the classroom teaching. This paper puts forward the reconstruction of efficient classroom teaching mode, makes great efforts to deepen the cooperation between industry and education in classroom teaching, and realizes the goal of ""1 + x""certificate system to cultivate talents. A three-stage tutoring mode of ""knowledge transfer before class,""""knowledge internalization in class,""and ""evaluation and reflection after class""is designed. Practice has proved that the combination of microclassroom and flipped classroom is an effective strategy to improve the effect of learning knowledge. It provides some references and suggestions for front-line teachers to implement flipped classroom teaching in the future.  © 2022 Fang Zheng.","","International trade; Knowledge management; Personnel training; Social networking (online); Classroom teaching; New teaching; Practice teachings; Professional training; Social media; Students' interests; Teachers'; Teaching concepts; Teaching effects; Trade practice; Students","","","","","","","Foster G., Stagl S., Design, implementation, and evaluation of an inverted (flipped) classroom model economics for sustainable education course, Journal of Cleaner Production, 183, MAY 10, pp. 1323-1336, (2018); Morton D.A., Colbert-Getz J.M., Measuring the impact of the flipped anatomy classroom: the importance of categorizing an assessment by Bloom's taxonomy, Anatomical Sciences Education, 10, 2, pp. 170-175, (2017); Chia-Wen T., Shen P.-D., Yi-Chun C., Chih-Hsien L., How to solve students' problems in a flipped classroom: a quasi-experimental approach[J], Universal Access in the Information Society, 16, 1, pp. 1-9, (2017); Xiang J., Evaluation of the college English flipped classroom teaching model based on data mining algorithms, Mobile Information Systems, 2021, (2021); Mohamed H., Lamia M., Implementing flipped classroom that used an intelligent tutoring system into learning process, Computers & Education, 124, SEP, pp. 62-76, (2018); Ng E., Integrating self-regulation principles with SPOCS pedagogy for first year university students[J], Computers & Education, 126, (2018); Persky A.M., Hogg A., Influence of reading material characteristics on study time for pre-class quizzes in a flipped classroom, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 81, 6, (2017); Yanfei Y., Online and offline mixed intelligent teaching assistant mode of English based on mobile information system, Mobile Information Systems, 2021, (2021); Chen J., Qian H., Zhao Q.-H., Yang L., Xiao-Min C.H.E.N., Constructing and exploration of multi-layer education system of polymer comprehensive experiment[J], Polymer Bulletin, 7, pp. 1-5, (2020); Wang Y., A study on college PE teaching system reform design based on SPOCS[J], Revista de la Facultad de Ingenieria, 32, 8, pp. 476-482, (2017); Qian Y., Li C.-X., Zou X.-G., Feng X.-B., Xiao M.-H., Ding Y.-Q., Research on predicting learning achievement in a flipped classroom based on MOOCs by big data analysis[J], Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 30, 4, pp. 222-234, (2021); Zheng X.-L., Kim H.-S., Lai W.-H., Hwang G.-J., Cognitive regulations in ICT-supported flipped classroom interactions: an activity theory perspective, British Journal of Educational Technology, 51, 1, pp. 103-130, (2020); Dai D.Y., Envisioning a new foundation for gifted education: evolving complexity theory (ECT) of talent development, Gifted Child Quarterly, 61, 3, pp. 172-182, (2017); Luo H., Yang T., Jin X., Impact of student agency on knowledge performance and knowledge experience in a SPOCS[J], British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 2, pp. 1-10, (2019); An X., Qu C., A hierarchical learning model based on deep learning and its application in a SPOC and flipped classroom[J], International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (IJET), 16, 9, pp. 76-93, (2021); Liu L., Research on IT English flipped classroom teaching model based on SPOC, Scientific Programming, 2021, 5, pp. 1-9, (2021); Shu L., Li G., Cao X., Research on the optimization and innovation of art SPOCS teaching based on the network environment[J], Boletin Tecnico/technical Bulletin, 55, 11, pp. 672-678, (2017); Hu Z., Research and practice on the tutorial mode of course project-take the ""credit rating"" course as an example[J], International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 57, 3, (2020); Bao Y., Teaching and practice research on flipped classroom of vocational English major writing course based on MOOC[J], Revista de la Facultad de Ingenieria, 32, 15, pp. 73-77, (2017)","F.

Their computational thinking skills take place around program decompositions, program patterns, and data representation in the shared Scratch programs (called projects). Through the exploratory work, we found that some cues, such as deep nested iteration, may be successfully used as indicators of users computational thinking skills. This suggests future directions for assessing youths computational thinking skills development and educational opportunities emerging from shared Scratch projects. © 2017 IEEE.","Computational thinking skill; Dr. Scratch; Scratch; Visual programming language; Visualization","Animation; Computational methods; Computer programming; Computer programming languages; Flow visualization; Social networking (online); Visualization; Computational thinkings; Data representations; Dr. Scratch; Educational opportunities; Online social networkings; Program decomposition; Scratch; Visual programming languages; Visual languages","","","","","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, (104-2628-S-024 -001 -MY3, 105-2511-S-024 -007 -MY3)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research reported in this paper has been supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan under research project numbers MOST 104-2628-S-024 -001 -MY3 and 105-2511-S-024 -007 -MY3.

Many fields and sectors are using mobile applications to facilitate their services. Education is an important field that can utilize the various features of mobile applications to assist students and educators. Students are learning several subjects and concepts in schools, including biology. With traditional teaching methods, students may face difficulties in grasping knowledge about human anatomy. This can affect the teaching effectiveness, students' learning process, their engagement in class, and their academic performance. To take full advantage of the technological tools available in the market and to improve teaching effectiveness in the biology field, this paper proposes an Augmented Reality Anatomy mobile application (ARA for short). With ARA, students can learn about human anatomy and organs using augmented reality technology. Among the interesting features of ARA are: Visualizing human anatomy as 3D models, examining the different human organs, controlling their visibility, recognizing drawings of organs, learning about each organ structure, function, and how to keep it healthy, and taking pictures and sharing them using social media platforms. More importantly, the proposed application enables the visualization of human anatomy without resorting to the marker tracking method. To evaluate the usefulness and the usability of the proposed application, the latter has been tested with students at the Genius Kids Center in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Positive feedback has been received from students who have enjoyed learning and interacting with human anatomy. © 2019 University of Bahrain.

Validated methods of evaluating surgical video are time-intensive, expensive, and involve participation of multiple expert surgeons. We sought to obtain valid performance scores of urologic trainees and faculty on a dry-laboratory robotic surgery task module by using crowdsourcing through a web-based grading tool called Crowd Sourced Assessment of Technical Skill (CSATS). Methods: IRB approval was granted to test the technical skills grading accuracy of Amazon.com Mechanical Turk™ crowd-workers compared to three expert faculty surgeon graders. The two groups assessed dry-laboratory robotic surgical suturing performances of three urology residents (PGY-2,-4,-5) and two faculty using three performance domains from the validated Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills assessment tool. Results: After an average of 2 hours 50 minutes, each of the five videos received 50 crowd-worker assessments. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the surgeons and crowd was 0.91 using Cronbach's alpha statistic (confidence intervals=0.20-0.92), indicating an agreement level between the two groups of ""excellent."" The crowds were able to discriminate the surgical level, and both the crowds and the expert faculty surgeon graders scored one senior trainee's performance above a faculty's performance. Conclusion: Surgery-naive crowd-workers can rapidly assess varying levels of surgical skill accurately relative to a panel of faculty raters. The crowds provided rapid feedback and were inexpensive. CSATS may be a valuable adjunct to surgical simulation training as requirements for more granular and iterative performance tracking of trainees become mandated and commonplace. © 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Clinical Competence; Crowdsourcing; Educational Measurement; Humans; Internship and Residency; Physicians; Reproducibility of Results; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Simulation Training; Suture Techniques; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Urology; Video Recording; accuracy; Article; assessment of humans; Crowd Sourced Assessment of Technical Skill; crowdsourcing; human; job performance; priority journal; residency education; resident; robot assisted surgery; skill; surgeon; surgical training; urology; clinical competence; crowdsourcing; education; medical education; physician; procedures; reproducibility; robotic surgical procedure; simulation training; suturing method; urologic surgery; urology; videorecording","","","","","","","Birkmeyer J.D., Finks J.F., O'Reilly A., Et al., Surgical skill and complication rates after bariatric surgery, N Engl J Med, 369, pp. 1434-1442, (2013); Rogers S.O., Gawande A.A., Kwaan M., Et al., Analysis of surgical errors in closed malpractice claims at 4 liability insurers, Surgery, 140, pp. 25-33, (2006); Van Hove P.D., Tuijthof G.J.M., Verdaasdonk E.G.G., Et al., Objective assessment of technical surgical skills, Br J Surg, 97, pp. 972-987, (2010); Datta V., Bann S., Mandalia M., Et al., The surgical efficiency score: A feasible, reliable, and valid method of skills assessment, Am J Surg, 192, pp. 372-378, (2006); Darzi A., Smith S., Taffinder N., Assessing operative skill Needs to become more objective, BMJ, 318, pp. 887-888, (1999); Mandel L.P., Lentz G.M., Goff B.A., Teaching and evaluating surgical skills, Obstet Gynecol, 95, pp. 783-785, (2000); Surowiecki J., The Wisdom of Crowds. 1st, (2005); Bigham J.P., Jayant C., Ji H., Et al., VizWiz: Nearly Real-time Answers to Visual Questions, Proceedings of the 23Nd Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, pp. 333-342, (2010); Khatib F., Cooper S., Tyka M.D., Et al., Algorithm discovery by protein folding game players, Proc Natl Acad Sci 2011; Chen C., White L., Kowalewski T., Et al., Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical Skills: A novel method to evaluate surgical performance, J Surg Res, 187, pp. 65-71, (2014); Tausch T.J., Kowalewski T.M., White L.W., Et al., Content and construct validation of a robotic surgery curriculum using an electromagnetic instrument tracker, J Urol, 188, pp. 919-923, (2012); Lendvay T.S., Hannaford B., Satava R.M., Future of robotic surgery, Cancer J Sudbury Mass, 19, pp. 109-119, (2013); Goh A.C., Goldfarb D.W., Sander J.C., Et al., Global evaluative assessment of robotic skills: Validation of a clinical assessment tool to measure robotic surgical skills, J Urol, 187, pp. 247-252, (2012); Cronbach L.J., Shavelson R.J., My current thoughts on coefficient alpha and successor procedures, Educ Psychol Meas, 64, pp. 391-418, (2004); Hiemstra E., Kolkman W., Wolterbeek R., Et al., Value of an objective assessment tool in the operating room, Can J Surg, 54, pp. 116-122, (2011); Drew P.J., Cule N., Gough M., Et al., Optimal education techniques for basic surgical trainees: Lessons from education theory, J R Coll Surg Edinb, 44, pp. 55-56, (1999); Schmidt R.A., Bjork R.A., New Conceptualizations of Practice: Common Principles in Three Paradigms Suggest New Concepts for Training, Psychol Sci, 3, pp. 207-217, (1992)","","","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","","","","","","08927790","","JENDE","25356517","English","J.

Materials and methods For this proof-of-concept study we focused on the field of Primary Care and Family Medicine. Six hashtags were selected based on their importance, from the ones included in the ‘Healthcare Hashtag Project’. Hashtag Global Reach (HGR) was calculated using the additive aggregation of five weighted, normalized indicator variables: number of impressions, tweets, tweeters, user locations, and user languages. Data were obtained for the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015 using Symplur Signals. Topic-specific HGR were calculated for the top 10 terms and for sets of quotes mapped after a thematic analysis. Individual Global Reach, IGR, was calculated across hashtags as additive indexes of three indicators: replies, retweets and mentions. Results Using the HGR score we were able to rank six selected hashtags and observe their performance throughout the study period. We found that #PrimaryCare and #FMRevolution had the highest HGR score in both quarters; interestingly, #FMChangeMakers experienced a marked increase in its global visibility during the study period. “Health Policy” was the commonest theme, while “Care”, “Family” and “Health” were the most common terms. Discussion This is the first study describing an altmetric hashtag index. Assuming analytical soundness, the Index might prove generalizable to other healthcare hashtags. If released as a real-time business intelligence tool with customizable settings, it could aid publishing and strategic decisions by netizens, organizations, and analysts. IGR could also serve to augment academic evaluation and professional development. Conclusion Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using an index on the global reach of healthcare hashtags and tweeters. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Bibliometrics; Family practice; Internet; Primary health care; Social media","Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Language; Publishing; Social Media; Terminology as Topic; Competitive intelligence; Health care; Internet; Medicine; Publishing; Social networking (online); Bibliometrics; Family practice; Indicator variables; Primary healthcare; Professional development; Real time business intelligence; Social media; Strategic decisions; Article; bibliometrics; controlled study; general practice; health care policy; health economics; human; Internet; language; primary health care; priority journal; professional development; social media; thematic analysis; total quality management; health care delivery; nomenclature; publishing; World Wide Web","","","","","","","Mesko B., Social Media in Clinical Practice, (2013); Pew Research Center, Social media update, (2013); Facebook, Company Info, Available from <> [accessed 16 October 2015 (archived by WebCite® at <>)]; Twitter, by the numbers, (2013); Thackeray R., Neiger B.L., Hanson C.L., Et al., Enhancing promotional strategies within social marketing programs: use of web 2.0 social media, Health Promot.

Digital technology has a profound influence on the artistic expression and language form changes. At present, the development of various digital technologies has emerged in an endless stream, which has brought a bright future for the development of digital technology in China. The digital media art major is an applied subject, and the practical teaching occupies an important position in the whole teaching system (Allen 2005). In recent years, new design concepts, new means of expression, new technology and so on are constantly emerging, and the requirements for design talents are becoming higher and higher. In the construction of practical teaching system, we should focus on the reform and construction of professional courses, formulate the planning ideas of curriculum construction, and revise the teaching plan, update the contents of practice teaching, and form a plan to improve teaching quality. © 2018 Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association.

These cases cover a wide range of topics, including: teacher evaluations, educational reforms, school safety, cultural differences, undocumented students, and social media. Each case study has three alternative responses written by experienced educational administrators and academics. The respondents were asked to identify the primary problem, along with secondary problems, and to provide a strategy that will address the problems identified. By providing three alternative responses to each case, a diverse range of problems and solutions are available for each case study. The organization and unique approach of Educational Leadership in Action allows for flexible use in courses for aspiring leaders to supplement core readings, reinforce central concepts, exemplify theory, and provide grounded examples to encourage learning. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-131769550-9; 978-113802098-6","","","English","Educational Leadersh. in Action: A Casebook for Aspiring Educational Leaders","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162623423"

Drawing on 5 years of social network data from one school district, we explore the relationship between teacher performance and teachers’ instructional advice and information interactions. Results demonstrate that higher performing teachers are not more likely to be sought out for advice; instead, higher performing teachers are more likely to seek advice. Although school staff report they can identify the “best” teachers, they generally do not rely on student test scores, instead relying on more readily accessible indicators of performance. These findings have important implications for policy and practices that seek to promote desired interactions among teachers. © 2018 AERA.","mixed methods; teacher assessment; teacher knowledge; testing","","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DUE-0831835, REC–9873583)","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Work on this article was supported by the NebraskaMATH Study (see http:// www.distributedleadership.org/projects.html) at Northwestern University and University of Nebraska– Lincoln, funded by research grants from the National Science Foundation (DUE-0831835).

This research comes from year two of a projected three-year-long study of ECRs from seven countries (China, France, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the US), for which semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with study participants. For the findings reported in this paper, fourteen Chinese ECRs from science and social science disciplines at six different universities were interviewed during the period from March to May 2017. The interview record was compared with the previous year’s (2016) record to identify changes in interviewees’ responses to a battery of questions. In addition, contextual data were obtained from the CVs of the ECRs. Our findings indicate that the scholarly communication attitudes and behaviours of Chinese ECRs have changed from year one to year two. We observed noteworthy changes in Chinese ECRs’ attitudes and behaviours regarding open access publishing and peer review. As compared with data from 2016, the ECRs are more positive about open access journals but more negative about the peer-review system. Social media and online communities are now more frequently used as supplementary channels for scholarly communication, and WeChat is becoming very popular for Chinese ECRs. Authorship policies, the academic evaluation system, and the prevalent use of social media are the most important factors bringing about the changes we observed. What remains unchanged for the Chinese ECRs is the persistent pressure they feel to publish papers in select journals in order to advance their careers. © 2018 University of Toronto Press.

E and ET faculty often require industry experience with the highest academic degree, and have higher teaching and research loads. Faculty are required to do a number of things that graduate school and/or industry practice don't teach them, such as planning and delivering courses effectively, designing and starting a research program to getting it funded, attracting and managing graduate students and undergraduate students, finding and working with appropriate faculty or industrial collaborators, writing assignments and tests that are both rigorous and fair, dealing with classroom management problems and students with a bewildering assortment of academic and personal problems, doing what it takes to learn about and integrate into the campus culture, and finding the time to do all that and still have a personal life (Adam et al. 2008, Felder et al. 2012; Kember and Kwan 2000). It becomes more challenging to get established when the department or the college does not have the adequate resources to support the new faculty, and lacks a formal faculty development and mentoring program on campus. There are some tricks of the trade-what I have learned from the literature and from my personal experience that will be shared in this article so that new E and ET faculty become more successful in their careers. Some of the key issues for E and ET faculty are related to effective teaching practices, finding time for research, inadequate feedback/recognition, unrealistic expectations from supervisors, insufficient resources and the lack of mentors. Tenure and promotion depends on faculty performance, university and departmental policy and procedures and academic and collegial environment on campus. This article will address some of the common issues and provide some ideas that new faculty can follow, and ultimately get tenured and become successful in his/her career. As Austin's study (2003) identified, concerns over leading a balanced faculty life and navigating the uncertainties coming from unclear expectations in new faculty roles, were plainly sources of stress for our participants. Budget cuts place stress on institutions and faculty to do more with less; shifts in preferred teaching methods from lecturing to active student-centered learning, and changing student and faculty demographics all contribute to a turbulent time on college campuses. As the newest institutional members, recent faculty hires are caught up in this changing context at the same time they are trying to establish themselves as new teachers and researchers. It is not surprising that one of the main points of stress for the participants was seeking a work-life balance. Charles Vest, President of National Academy of Engineering has mentioned the following: ""the engineering workforce of tomorrow, and indeed that of today, will face profound new challenges. Every day the men and women of this workforce will face the stress of competing in the fast-paced world of change we call the knowledge-based global economy of the twenty-first century. They will also face even larger challenges because the nation and world will need to call on them to seize opportunities and solve global problems of unprecedented scope and scale"" (Vest, Charles, 2008)"". In the long run, his suggestion is to make engineering and engineering technology schools exciting, creative, adventurous, rigorous, demanding, and empowering. That means faculty who design curricula, pedagogy, and student experiences will profitably contemplate the new context, competition, content, and challenges of engineering. Due to the part of the rapidly increasing power and changes of technology, routine tasks that were traditionally performed by engineers and/or engineering technologists (E and ET) are now performed by technicians using computers while E and ETs are called upon to design, develop and use innovative products and processes, exercise new and unfamiliar technical and professional skills, and function in an increasingly global environment. What it will mean to be an E and ET in the twenty-first century and the incompatibility of current E and ET curricula with that meaning have been the subject of many high-level studies. The debate so far has had little impact on STEM educators. According to the criteria set by Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET), we must strengthen our coverage of fundamentals; teach more about ""real-world"" engineering design, development, and operations; cover more material in frontier areas of engineering and engineering technologists; offer better instruction in both oral and written communication skills and teamwork skills; provide training in critical and creative thinking skills and problem-solving methods; produce graduates who are conversant with engineering ethics and the connections between technology and society so that the average student can complete the undergraduate degree in four years (ABET.org). In view of the broadening and rapidly shifting scope of the profession and ABET criteria, it is imperative to shift the focus of E and ET curricula from transmission of content to the development of skills, that support thinking and professional judgment. Future E and ETs will need to adapt to rapidly changing work environments and technology, direct their own learning, broaden an understanding of impact, work across different perspectives, and continually revisit what it means to be an engineer and engineering technologist. Traditional approaches to E and ET education (chalk-and-talk lectures, individual homework) are becoming incompatible. Furthermore, research on student engagement has moved the boundaries of learning environments beyond formal classrooms to informal spaces such as student lounges, professional work spaces, and virtual community spaces. What remains crucial is the importance of social learning as students interact with others such as peers, educators, campus administrators, internship supervisors, alumni and professionals, and even in social media. As such, the teaching decisions E and ET educators make can impact learning in and out of the classroom (Adam and Felder, 2008). If courses are continued to be taught in a single subject format, (statics in one course, thermodynamics in another, technical writing in another, etc.) it will take a six-or sevenyear curriculum to produce engineers and/or engineering technologist who have the desired proficiency in the fundamentals, and are conversant with methods of modern E and ET practice, culturally literate, and skilled in communication. Moreover, if students are assigned only well-defined convergent problems, they will never gain the skills needed to tackle and solve challenging multidisciplinary problems that call for critical judgment and creativity according to ABET. Finally, even if nothing new is added to the existing curriculum, confining it to four years will be almost impossible, unless more efficient and effective ways to cover the material can be found (Felder et. All., 2000). In that case, it becomes very difficult for new faculty to teach undergraduate students at a level it should be, and become successful in their academic career with the further expectation of research and services. There is another belief among some of us: if we have significant industry experience, we can be an effective teacher and successful faculty or vice versa, meaning that successful researchers automatically convert to an effective teacher. Although transferring skills is important and can be good for the academic career, it by no means suggests that industry experience or research success will be enough to make a faculty successful. Some of the advantages of new faculty having industry experience are discussed below. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","","","","","","","","","Accreditation Criteria from Policy and Procedural Manual; Adams R.S., Felder R., Reframing professional development: A systems approach to preparing engineering educators to educate tomorrow's engineers, Journal of Engineering Education, pp. 239-241, (2008); Austin A.E., Creating a bridge to the future: Preparing new faculty to face changing expectations in a shifting context, Review of Higher Education, 26, pp. 119-144, (2003); Boice R., The New Faculty Member, (1992); Browne E., Structural and pedagogic change in further and higher education: A case study approach, Journal of Further and Higher Education, 29, 1, (2005); Burkhardt H., Schoenfeld A.H., Improving educational research: Toward a more useful, more influential, and better-funded enterprise, Educational Researcher, 32, 9, pp. 3-14, (2003); Eddy P.L., Gaston-Gales J., New faculty on the block: Issues of stress and support, Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 17, 1-2, pp. 89-106, (2008); Felder R.M., Brent R., Helping New Faculty Members Get off to a Good Start, (2012); Jossey-Bass, Boice R., Advice for New Faculty Members, (2000); Kember D., Kwan K.P., Lecturers' approaches to teaching and their relationship to conceptions of good teaching.

Introduction Collaboration is about people working together on projects. In education, teachers work together in social networks to improve student learning in the classroom; for example, by exchanging teaching ideas. Classrooms are also becoming collaborative spaces where teachers can guide the learning to achieve their teaching and learning goals and those of their students. Students collaborate to deepen their understanding of scientific concepts. Collaboration is an important part of pre-service teacher education and teacher professional learning in science education domains. Collaboration may take a number of different forms; for example, groups of university researchers working with teachers to develop a teaching resource, a teacher mentoring a pre-service teacher, a university lecturer teaching a pre-service teacher or delivering teacher professional learning to a classroom educator, or simply two teachers or two pre-service teachers working together on a lesson or unit plan or reflecting on the impact of the lesson presented. This chapter outlines how you as pre-service teachers and classroom teachers can collaborate to enhance your science teaching and to utilise collaborative reflection, the natural partner to collaborative enhancement. The chapter also outlines how repeated cycles, or iterations, rather than single instances of enhancement and reflection can improve teaching. The final section of this chapter speaks to transferable teaching skills that require collaboration for their development and continued effectiveness. OPENING VIGNETTE As teachers we want our students to be able to ‘think and act in scientific ways’ (ACARA, 2012). Listening to scientists talk about scientific thinking and problem solving is one way to help us to understand it. Scientific thinking is both similar to and different from everyday thinking and problem solving. © Cambridge University Press 2018.","","","","","","","","","Tytler R., Symington D., Smith C., A curriculum innovation framework for science, technology and mathematics education, Research in Science Education, 41, 1, pp. 19-38, (2011); Kim M., Lavonen J., Juuti K., Holbrook J., Rannikmae M., Teacher’s reflection of inquiry teaching in Finland before and during an in-service program: Examination by a progress model of collaborative reflection, International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 11, 2, pp. 359-383, (2013); Zeichner K.M., Liston D.P., Reflective teaching: An introduction, (2013); Howitt C., Science for early childhood teacher education students (ECTES): Collaboration between teacher educators, scientists and engineers, (2010); Tripp D., Critical incidents in teaching (classic edition): Developing professional judgment, (2011); Doig B., Groves S., Japanese lesson study: Teacher professional development through communities of enquiry, Mathematics Teacher Education and Development, 13, 1, pp. 77-93, (2011); Niss M., Hojgaard T., Competencies and mathematical learning: Ideas and inspiration for the development of mathematics teaching and learning in Denmark, (2011); Altrichter H., Feldman A., Posch P., Somekh B., Teachers investigate their work: An introduction to action research across the professions, (2013); The Australian Curriculum: Version 3.1, (2012); Teacher Standards, (2012); Barab S.A., Plucker J.A., Smart people or smart contexts?

Although feedback can arguably shift students from their current level toward their desired goals, students in higher education rate it as one of the least satisfactory areas partly because of the unidirectional nature of written feedback. This paper contains a case study of a university English teacher's use of audio feedback on a popular social media platform in China. This study includes an analysis of the teacher's audio feedback and follow-up interactions with the students on the popular WeChat application, teacher interviews, student reflective journals, and 10 classroom observations of student presentations. The study found that many features of the teacher's audio feedback contributed to student learning. The findings also reveal how the instructor's audio feedback on social media created opportunities for dialogic feedback by increasing student engagement with the comments and enhancing meaning negotiation, as well as how the teacher and students perceive the use of audio feedback. These findings are discussed in terms of creating dialogical feedback contexts for student learning, incorporating the use of audio feedback into teacher assessment literacy, and utilizing social media as an innovative platform for audio feedback. It concludes with implications for feedback practice in higher education and teacher assessment education. © Copyright © 2018 Xu.","audio feedback; case study; China; higher education; social media; university English teacher","","","","","","National Social Science Foundation of China in Education, (BIA180186)","Financial support for this study was provided by the National Social Science Foundation of China in Education (Grant No. BIA180186).","Black P., Wiliam D., Assessment and classroom learning, Assess.Educ, 5, pp. 7-74, (1998); Boud D., Molloy E., Rethinking models of feedback for learning: the challenge of design, Assess.

In face-to-face classrooms, previous research has identified conversational techniques, such as open-ended questions and uptake of what others have said, that can promote dialogic, whole-class discussions. However, few studies have examined how students’ participation can be enabled and constrained by the visual design of online forums. This article evaluates three online conversations among students of different disciplines and geographic regions at secondary, postsecondary, and graduate levels, evaluating the success of each example based first on conversational techniques and then on the visual design of the online forum. Rhetorical principles such as contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity may help teachers evaluate and redesign potential online forums for more effective online discussions, including how classroom setup, routines, and multimedia can shape students’ participation. © 2017 International Literacy Association","3-Early adolescence;

The use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as blackboard, eCollege, Moodle and others are being used throughout the educational sector. Some even incorporate such technology to measure teaching effectiveness and student performance. Furthermore, social websites, like Facebook.com, have become so popular that 85% to 99% of college students use it in one form or another. This research explores the students' perspective on how the effectiveness of tools such as Moodle and Facebook.com as well as paper based learning (traditional learning) on their performance. The paper also looks at different factors, such as gender, major type and age to try to shed light on the preferred tool among students to use for education. When it comes to students' tool preference based on age and gender, we found no significant difference, but when looking at students' majors and time spent in university, we found that Moodle was rated the top, followed by paper-based learning, then Facebook. When viewing students' perception on effect of these tools on performance, we found no statistical significant difference by age or time spent in the university, but did find a significant difference among different genders; where male students showed greater satisfaction than did female students, and statistical significant different among majors. © 2018 Kassel University Press GmbH.","Facebook; Moodle; Paper-based assessment; Students' perception","Social networking (online); Educational sectors; Facebook; Learning management system; Moodle; Student performance; Students' perspectives; Teaching effectiveness; Traditional learning; Students","","","","","","","Avila V.J.G., Hembra N.G., Mueco J.M., Zamora F.G., Moodle and Facebook As a tool for delivering instruction and attainment of learning, Communication Research, 2, pp. 227-250, (2015); Boghikian-Whitby S., Mortagy Y., Student preferences and performance in online and face-to-face classes using Myers-Briggs indicator: A longitudinal quasiexperimental study, Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology, 13, pp. 89-109, (2016); Canada K., Pringle R., The role of gender in college classroom interactions: A social context approach, Sociology of Education, 68, pp. 161-186, (1995); Chang W.L., Lee C.Y., Trust as a learning facilitator that affects students' learning performance in the Facebook community: An investigation in a business planning writing course, Computers & Education, 62, pp. 320-327, (2013); Courduff J., One size never fits all: Tech integration for special needs, Learning & Leading With Technology, 38, 8, pp. 16-19, (2011); Crombie G., Pyke S.W., Silverthorn N., Jones A., Piccinin S., Students' perceptions of their classroom participation and instructor as a function of gender and context, The Journal of Higher Education, 74, pp. 51-76, (2003); DeNeui D.L., Dodge T.L., Asynchronous learning networks and student outcomes: The utility of online learning components in hybrid courses, Journal of Instructional Psychology, 33, 4, pp. 256-259, (2006); Deng L., Tavares N.J., From Moodle to Facebook: Exploring students' motivation and experiences in online communities, Computers & Education, 68, pp. 167-176, (2013); Driscoll A., Jicha K., Hunt A.N., Tichavsky L., Thompson G., Can online courses deliver in-class results?

We apply COMAS in the context of communities of learners, and we compute the group opinion from the perspective of the teacher. Specifically, our model relies on teacher assessments, aggregations of student assessments and trust measures derived from student assessments to suggest marks to assignments that have not been assessed by the teacher. The proposed model intends to support intelligent online learning applications by (1) encouraging students to assess one another, and (2) benefiting from students' assessments. We believe the task of assessing massive numbers of students is of special interest to online learning communities, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs). Experimental results were conducted on a real classroom datasets as well as simulated data that considers different social network topologies (where we say students assess some assignments of socially connected students). Results show that our method (1) is sound, i.e. the error of the suggested assessments decreases for increasing numbers of teacher assessments; and (2) scales for large numbers of students. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These cases cover a wide range of topics, including: teacher evaluations, educational reforms, school safety, cultural differences, undocumented students, and social media. Each case study has three alternative responses written by experienced educational administrators and academics. The respondents were asked to identify the primary problem, along with secondary problems, and to provide a strategy that will address the problems identified. The chapter explains that the students had educational needs that teachers had never confronted. The students had social needs all were coming from refugee camps and many were unaccompanied. The students were coming from a third-world country into a world with electricity, running water, roads with controlled traffic, bathrooms and plentiful food. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-131769550-9; 978-113802098-6","","","English","Educational Leadersh. in Action: A Casebook for Aspiring Educational Leaders","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162699895"

Previous studies reveal that mobile gaming gratifies a new play experience in casual, flexible and ubiquitous nature. Additionally, mobile gaming generates widely accepted gratifications in technology-based education, improving learning and teaching performance in education in general and specific courses. Meanwhile, mobile gaming demonstrates great gratification effect in quality, ability and physical training. Furthermore, scholars have widely researched on the gratification effect of mobile gaming to promote social networking with the applications of socially interactive technologies. Finally, this chapter delivers a forecast about the future development of mobile gaming into HR recruitment and management. © 2016 by IGI Global.

Such interactions happen in both online and class room settings. While teaching effectiveness is the goal in both settings, the mechanism to achieve the same could differ in different settings. In order to characterize these interactions multimodal behavioral signals and language use need to be measured, and a model to predict effectiveness needs to be learnt. These would help characterize the teaching skill of the teacher and level of engagement of students. Also, there could be multiple styles of teaching which can be effective. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Educational Data Mining; Multimodal Learning Analytics; Teaching Analytics","Data mining; E-learning; Interactive computer systems; Automatic analysis; Educational data mining; Educational settings; Multi-modal learning; Multimodal teachings; Teacher student interactions; Teaching analytics; Teaching effectiveness; Students","","","","","","","Baltrusaitis T., Mahmoud M., Robinson P., Cross-dataset learning and person-specific normalisation for automatic action unit detection, Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG), 2015 11th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on, 6, pp. 1-6, (2015); Baltrusaitis T., Robinson P., Morency L.-P., Constrained local neural fields for robust facial landmark detection in the wild, Proceedings of The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, pp. 354-361, (2013); Baltrusaitis T., Robinson P., Morency L.-P., OpenFace: An open source facial behavior analysis toolkit, Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2016 IEEE Winter Conference on, pp. 1-10, (2016); Bidwell J., Fuchs H., Classroom analytics: Measuring student engagement with automated gaze tracking, Behav Res Methods, 49, (2011); Weenink David Boersma P., Praat: Doing Phonetics by Computer [Computer Program], (2018); Cao Z., Simon T., Wei S.-E., Sheikh Y., Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields, CVPR, (2017); Chen L., Leong C.W., Feng G., Lee C.M., Using multimodal cues to analyze mla'14 oral presentation quality corpus: Presentation delivery and slides quality, Proceedings of The 2014 ACM Workshop on Multimodal Learning Analytics Workshop and Grand Challenge, pp. 45-52, (2014); Chen L., Leong C.W., Feng G., Lee C.M., Somasundaran S., Utilizing multimodal cues to automatically evaluate public speaking performance, Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), 2015 International Conference on, pp. 394-400, (2015); Cheng D.S., Salamin H., Salvagnini P., Cristani M., Vinciarelli A., Murino V., Predicting online lecture ratings based on gesturing and vocal behavior, Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces, 8, 2, pp. 151-160, (2014); Curtis K., Jones G.J.F., Campbell N., Effects of good speaking techniques on audience engagement, Proceedings of The 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, pp. 35-42, (2015); D'Cunha A., Gupta A., Awasthi K., Balasubramanian V., Daisee: Towards User Engagement Recognition in The Wild, (2016); Echeverria V., Avendano A., Chiluiza K., Vasquez A., Ochoa X., Presentation skills estimation based on video and kinect data analysis, Proceedings of The 2014 ACM Workshop on Multimodal Learning Analytics Workshop and Grand Challenge, pp. 53-60, (2014); Hidalgo G., Et al., OpenPose: Real-Time Multi-Person Keypoint Detection Library for Body, Face, and Hands Estimation, (2017); Eyben F., Schuller B., Opensmile:): The Munich open-source large-scale multimedia feature extractor, ACM SIGMultimedia Records, 6, 4, pp. 4-13, (2015); Giannakopoulos T., Pyaudioanalysis: An open-source python library for audio signal analysis, PloS One, 10, (2015); Mariooryad S., Kannan A., Hakkani-Tur D., Shriberg E., Automatic characterization of speaking styles in educational videos, Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2014 IEEE International Conference on, pp. 4848-4852, (2014); Enhancing teaching and learning through educational data mining and learning analytics: An issue brief, Proceedings of Conference on Advanced Technology for Education, (2012); Mustafa A., Kaur A., Mehta L., Dhall A., Prediction and Localization of Student Engagement in The Wild, (2018); Qin J., Zhou Y., Lu H., Ya H., Teaching video analytics based on student spatial and temporal behavior mining, Proceedings of The 5th ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, pp. 635-642, (2015); Raca M., Camera-Based Estimation of Student"" S Attention in Class, (2015); Ramanarayanan V., Leong C.W., Chen L., Feng G., Suendermann-Oeft D., Evaluating speech, face, emotion and body movement time-series features for automated multimodal presentation scoring, Proceedings of The 2015 ACM on International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, pp. 23-30, (2015); Sharma A., Biswas A., Gandhi A., Patil S., Deshmukh O., Livelinet: A multimodal deep recurrent neural network to predict liveliness in educational videos, EDM, pp. 215-222, (2016); Sharma R., Guha T., Sharma G., Multichannel Attention Network for Analyzing Visual Behavior in Public Speaking, (2017); Simon T., Joo H., Matthews I., Sheikh Y., Hand Key-point Detection in Single Images using Multiview Bootstrapping, CVPR, (2017); Strangert E., Gustafson J., What makes a good speaker?

These cases cover a wide range of topics, including: teacher evaluations, educational reforms, school safety, cultural differences, undocumented students, and social media. Each case study has three alternative responses written by experienced educational administrators and academics. The respondents were asked to identify the primary problem, along with secondary problems, and to provide a strategy that will address the problems identified. The primary problem facing Susan Jacobs, the superintendent of schools, is providing services to 500 new students who are refugees from Somali, Burma and Ethiopia when school is opening in less than one month. The district has had no advance notice of their arrival, so it has not budgeted money for the services these children will need from the public school system. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-131769550-9; 978-113802098-6","","","English","Educational Leadersh. in Action: A Casebook for Aspiring Educational Leaders","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162723410"

The results of the study show that both subgroups of teachers only sometimes or rarely use various digital media, with the exception of the frequent use of PowerPoint presentations. On the other hand, all teachers are positively motivated to use digital media in teaching. Both elementary and secondary school teachers hold that the teaching they organise is constructivist learning; elementary school teachers assess such forms of learning somewhat more positively. More positive values and expectations from the use of digital media are correlated, in both groups of teachers, with the more frequent use of such media in teaching. The use of certain digital media by both elementary and secondary school teachers is correlated with teaching where pupils learn collaboratively and have control over their own process of learning. It is justified to conclude, based on the interpretation of the results of this study, that despite the positive motivation to use digital media in teaching and the assessment that the learning organised by teachers is constructivist, in general teachers still work to a great extent in a way that is focused on the teacher and the subject, which is confirmed by the frequent use of PowerPoint presentations (frontal teaching).

We examine the extent to which pre-service elementary teachers’ social relationships and perceptions of peer trust and efficacy are associated with performance on a high stakes mathematics teaching assessment. Findings suggest that social and emotional support through close social ties, peer trust, and self-efficacy are significantly and positively associated with pre-service teachers’ teaching performance.

It provides students with snapshots of the day-to-day issues that educational administrators face. Each case study ends with explicit questions that direct students on interpretation. The chapter talks about safety of the school students. The organization and unique approach of Educational Leadership in Action allows for flexible use in courses for aspiring leaders to supplement core readings, reinforce central concepts, exemplify theory, and provide grounded examples to encourage learning. This essential compendium of cases prepares future leaders to frame problems, identify solutions, and develop strategies to meet the multiple challenges and competing demands in rapidly changing education contexts. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-131769550-9; 978-113802098-6","","","English","Educational Leadersh. in Action: A Casebook for Aspiring Educational Leaders","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162671545"

To help them in coping with this issue, an online support program has been created, where teachers can pose their problems on ICT and they can receive solutions from other teachers. A Recommender System has been defined and implemented into the support program to suggest to each teacher the most suitable solution based on her Skills, Competences, and Attitude toward ICT (SCAT-ICT). The support program has initially been populated with 70 problems from 86 teachers. 30 teachers grouped these problems into six categories with the card-sorting technique. Real solutions to these problems have been proposed by 25 trained teachers. Finally, 17 teachers evaluated the usability of the support program and the Recommender System, where results showed a high score on the standardized System Usability Scale. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","ICT support; Problem-solving; Recommendations; Techno-anxiety; Techno-fatigue; Techno-stress","Education; Problem solving; Recommender systems; Social networking (online); Information and communications technology; Personalized recommendation; Real solutions; Recommendations; Suitable solutions; Support programs; System usability; Techno-anxiety; Teaching","","","","","","","Anderson A., Huttenlocher D., Kleinberg J., Leskovec J., Discovering value from community activity on focused question answering sites: A case study of stack overflow, Proceedings of the 18th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'12), pp. 850-858, (2012); Boulton H., Hramiak A., Cascading the use of Web 2.0 technology in secondary schools in the United Kingdom: Identifying the barriers beyond pre-service training, Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 23, pp. 151-165, (2014); Bozo J., Alarcon R., Iribarra S., Recommending learning objects according to a teacher's context model, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6383, pp. 470-475, (2010); Budalakoti S., DeAngelis D., Barber K.S., Expertise modeling and recommendation in online, International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, 2009 (CSE'09), pp. 481-488, (2009); Burke R., Hybrid Recommender Systems: Survey and experiments, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 12, pp. 331-370, (2002); Carr T., Cox G., Deacon A., Morrison A., Teaching with technology.

Each case study has three alternative responses written by experienced educational administrators and academics. The respondents were asked to identify the primary problem, along with secondary problems, and to provide a strategy that will address the problems identified.

However, it is used quite often in the cases when quantitatively evaluating the academic impact is required. With the development of social networks, it is natural to ask the question: is there any trustworthy model which is able to provide quantitatively analysis of the academic impact with a huge amount of relevant information instead of peer-review only before the prevalence of social media? Many efforts have been devoted to provide the standard academic evaluation indicators, but they are either inadequate to be fully qualified or unable to become the universal applicable measure. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach, named Attenuation Mechanism, to quantitatively analysis the academic evaluation based on four estimated factors. It would bring new insights into how the academic impact takes place and the influence it has (either short term or long term). The extensive experiments on real academic search datasets show that the proposed model can perform significantly better than the baseline models in different areas and different disciplines. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Academic evaluation; Attenuation-Mechanism; Quantitative analysis","Artificial intelligence; Chemical analysis; Computer science; Computers; Academic evaluation; Academic search; Baseline models; Evaluation indicators; nocv1; Peer review; Short term; Social media; Education","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61170192)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundations of China (No. 61170192).","Garfield E., The history and meaning of the journal impact factor, JAMA J.

The important attribute taken by most of the researchers to improve the engineering education are student satisfaction level and faculty performance evaluation. There are several methods and existing techniques are used by institutions to get the view of students, from which commonly used method is feedback system. Due to the drawbacks of traditional feedback system, getting the original emotion of student as a feedback is very difficult. The proposed idea focuses on analyzing the views of the students in social media rather than investigating the formal feedback system.

The task of the teacher is to support students in the learning process, not only in the educational organization. In the conditions of the educational process informatization, students must learn how to manage the flow of information, while the teacher shall be with them everywhere, including the various social networks that have recently become very popular. The teacher shall act as an adviser, moderator of students' actions. In such circumstances, the role of educational technology increases; it goes beyond the school context and becomes important in the educational process carried out, for example, within the social networks. Methods: The paper describes the different approaches to the formation and improvement of the teacher's pedagogical techniques on the basis of national and foreign literature. The authors have described the technology of pedagogical techniques improvement with the use of information technologies on the basis of self-correction by the teacher of his own pedagogical techniques. Technology tools consist of three authorial programs designed to: Register the opinion of students and other teachers; evaluate the assessment of teacher's pedagogical techniques; study the trajectory of the teacher's movement in the classroom. Findings: The authors have provided the proof of objectivity of the results and reliability of the study, as well as the proof of quality of the tool for self-correcting the pedagogical techniques by the teacher. The paper proves the effectiveness of the described technology.

At the same time, it is a challenging problem to build appropriate psychometric models to analyze data collected from these tasks, due to the complexity of the data. This study focuses on process data collected from SBTs. We explore the potential of using concepts and methods from social network analysis to represent and analyze process data. Empirical data were collected from the assessment of Technology and Engineering Literacy, conducted as part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress. For the activity sequences in the process data, we created a transition network using weighted directed networks, with nodes representing actions and directed links connecting two actions only if the first action is followed by the second action in the sequence. This study shows how visualization of the transition networks represents process data and provides insights for item design. This study also explores how network measures are related to existing scoring rubrics and how detailed network measures can be used to make intergroup comparisons.

The objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the design and practice of the Intensive English Blended Learning program; 2) reflect on the perceptions of students and teachers who participated in the Intensive English Blended Learning program toward its practice and learning outcome; and 3) derive a lesson learned from designing and implementing blended learning for an English remedial course for an EFL context. 1,893 students and 42 teachers participated in the 5-week practice in which 54 hours (60%) were designated for face to face lessons with the teacher and 36 hours (40%) were designated to online learning by attending the language lab. In addition to the 54 hours, students were also required to do online self-study at any place and anytime for at least 12 hours per week. Data was collected from multiple sources including syllabus analysis, student open-ended questionnaire, teacher open-ended questionnaire, the records of test results and grades. Findings suggested that the blended Intensive English offered a suitable proportion between the face to face learning and online learning in enhancing students' proficiency and other valuable skills. The post test result showed that 93.32% of 1,893 students have improved their English skills as their test scores raised to CEFR A2 level or greater and the grade result also showed that 97.62% of 1,893 students received satisfactory grades. Furthermore, qualitative data revealed that students valued the blended learning approach in enhancing their English language skills and their self-directed learning skills. In contrast, teachers expressed frustration in adjusting themselves and coping with the integration of blended learning approach with the Intensive English despite recognizing its benefits. Lessons learned from the case study are 1) despite appreciating blended learning approach, most students appreciated face-to-face platform more than the online platform; 2) both students and teachers evaluated that the commercial online English learning program was not as suitable nor effective for them as they expected; and 3) the technical supporting system of the Internet provided by the university and the company needed improvement. The conclusion of this case study is that despite the success of achieving the desired learning outcome, the content and the learning platforms of the Intensive English Blended Learning program continue to need revision and redesign for the coming implementation round. © 2018 Asian E F L Journal Press.

The chapter explains a realistic portrayal of the pressures facing many school districts to acquire technology quickly and without clear instructional aims. Jerry, the Director of Technology, is caught in the middle between these pressures and his own beliefs about the districts technology needs.

However, certain competencies can enable the teachers to enhance their performance by managing self and adopting flexible teaching and learning tools. The purpose of this paper is to identify, analyse and model such competencies with special reference to emotional intelligence and social media competencies (SMCs). A competency framework is developed and a subsequent performance ranking system is derived in this study. Design/methodology/approach: The statistical approach of multiple regression using partial least square based strucutural equation modelling is used for model development by estimating the impact of various competencies on performance. The technique of analytical network process is applied to derive a performance management system for ranking employees. Findings: The paper estimates the relative impact of various competencies on superior performance of teachers, thus enabling to develop a competency model. A performance management and ranking system has also been developed. Practical implications: A working practical model for performance management and ranking of teachers is developed on the basis of different criteria having different weightage. The ranking model can enable to develop suitable strategies for making effective recruitment and appraisal decisions. Originality/value: The performance management model integrates emotional intelligence competencies, SMCs along with knowledge, skills and attitude, to develop fair and weightage-based performance ranking system. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytical network process; Emotional intelligence competencies; Social media competencies; Structural equation modelling; Teaching competencies; Teaching effectiveness","","","","","","","","Allodi M.W., A two-level analysis of classroom climate in relation to social context, group composition, and organization of special support, Learning Environments Research, 5, 3, pp. 253-274, (2002); Anari N., Teachers emotional intelligence, job satisfaction and organizational commitment, Journal of Workplace Learning, 24, 4, pp. 256-269, (2011); Ashworth P., Saxton J., On competence, Journal of Further and Higher Education, 14, 2, pp. 3-25, (1990); Barclay D., Thompson R., Higgins C., The partial least squares (PLS) approach to causal modeling: personal computer adoption and use an illustration, Technology Studies, 2, 2, pp. 285-309, (1995); Baruah T.D., Effectiveness of social media as a tool of communication and its potential for technology enabled connections: a micro-level study, International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications, 2, 5, pp. 1-10, (2012); Bell M.H.J., New shifts in the electronic media enhance the writing skills of students, ELK Asia Pacific Journals, (2015); Blaskova M., Blasko R., Kucharcikova A., Key personality competences of university teacher: comparison of requirements defined by teachers and/versus defined by students, Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 159, 159, pp. 457-467, (2014); Boyatzis R.E., The Competent Manager: A Model for Effective Performance, (1982); Boyatzis R.E., Competencies as a behavioral approach to emotional intelligence, Journal of Management Development, 28, 9, pp. 749-770, (2009); Brackett M., Caruso D., Emotional Literacy for Educators, (2007); Chadha N.K., Singh D., How to measure your EQ, Emotional Intelligence at Work: A Professional Guide, (2001); Chapman D.S., Webster J., The use of technologies in the recruiting, screening, and selection processes for job candidates, International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 11, 2-3, pp. 113-120, (2003); Chen S.H., Wang P.W., Lee H.T., Performance measurement considering the interdependence of evaluators and criteria, Quality and Quantity, 46, 1, pp. 103-115, (2010); Cheung W., Cheng Y., A multi-level framework for self-management in school, International Journal of Education Management, 10, 1, pp. 17-29, (1996); Chin W.W., The partial least squares approach for structural equation modeling, Suhanet al Assessment of PLS-SEM Path Model for Coefficient13ed, pp. 295-336, (1998); Correa T., Hinsley A., Zuniga H., Who interacts on the web?

This concern has grown with the increase of peer assessment in digital platforms. In this meta-analysis, using a variance-known hierarchical linear modelling approach, we synthesise findings from studies on peer assessment since 1999 when computer-assisted peer assessment started to proliferate. The estimated average Pearson correlation between peer and teacher ratings is found to be.63, which is moderately strong. This correlation is significantly higher when: (a) the peer assessment is paper-based rather than computer-assisted; (b) the subject area is not medical/clinical; (c) the course is graduate level rather than undergraduate or K-12; (d) individual work instead of group work is assessed; (e) the assessors and assessees are matched at random; (f) the peer assessment is voluntary instead of compulsory; (g) the peer assessment is non-anonymous; (h) peer raters provide both scores and qualitative comments instead of only scores; and (i) peer raters are involved in developing the rating criteria. The findings are expected to inform practitioners regarding peer assessment practices that are more likely to exhibit better agreement with teacher assessment. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","meta-analysis;

First, we briefly describe a concentration of knowledge about computers and their use, coalescing into the concept of ICT literacy in the early years of the field.Second, we describe the transition to a view of ICT literacy as a broad set of skills that have links to many traditional and non-traditional school subjects, and the move to technology integration in education.Third, we see the next transition for ICT literacy expressed as progress variables that are essential tools for the design of curriculum and assessments.Fourth, we discuss the impact of the ""social network"" perspective on ICT literacy-the critical need for building the power of virtual skills through proficiency with networks of people, information, tools, and resources.In summary, we offer a new framework for assessing student ICT learning, based on a learning progression and social networking point of view. Throughout, we use extensive examples to help illustrate our review of the broad sweep of this development, and, as a part of the conclusion, we speculate about the coming next steps. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ICT literacy; Intellectual capital; Learning in digital communities; Social capital; Social networks","","","","","","Microsoft","We would like to thank the ACT21S ICT Literacy Expert Panel for their work on the ICT Literacy Expert Panel: John Ainley (Chair), Julian Fraillon, Peter Pirolli, Jean-Paul Reeff, Kathleen Scalise, and Mark Wilson.

This study was carried out in five steps. Firstly we sorted out all the related studies to make exhaustive understanding of the existing methods and conclusions for evaluating the usability of altmetrics. Secondly, the evaluation method was proposed and the dataset was constructed, which consisted of 18 altmetrics indicators of papers from 10 disciplines and published in recent 10 years. Thirdly, for every indicator we studied the distribution of coverage and mean count over time to analyze the indicators' accumulation characteristics and focus on early literature. In the fourth part, the value of every indicator and the redundancy among values were studied. The approaches included correlation analysis between altmetrics indicators and citation, correlation analysis with each other among altmetrics indicators, and PCA among all indicators. In the last, we analyzed some factors that may affect the usability of altmetrics, such as discipline, JIF, country, language and so on. The conclusions of this article are as follows. Some altmetrics indicators just pay attention to newly published papers, while other indicators could have wider coverage. This situation causes different data accumulation process. It's common to find redundancies among indicators in value. The value reflected by altmetrics is various and not limited to academic value. Besides, the application of altmetrics in academic evaluation must consider discipline, JIF, language, country and so on.","Academic evaluation; Altmetrics; Online academic communication; Social media","Correlation methods; Redundancy; Academic evaluation; Accumulation characteristics; Altmetrics; Correlation analysis; Data accumulation; Social media; Usability engineering","","","","","","","Alhoori H., Ray Choudhury S., Kanan T., Fox E., Furuta R., Giles C.L., On the relationship between open access and altmetrics, IConference 2015 Proceedings, (2015); Alperin J.P., Geographic variation in social media metrics: An analysis of Latin American journal articles, Aslib Journal of Information Management, 67, 3, pp. 289-304, (2015); Bollen J., Van De Sompel H., Hagberg A., Chute R., A principal component analysis of 39 scientific impact measures, PloS One, 4, 6, (2009); Bornmann L., Validity of altmetrics data for measuring societal impact: A study using data from Altmetric and F1000Prime, Journal of Informetrics, 8, 4, pp. 935-950, (2014); Bornmann L., Haunschild R., How to normalize Twitter counts?

Data analysis showed that disadvantaged youth may be more interested in the gaming site and that the interest was a negative predictor of academic performance in the subsequent year. © 2014 British Educational Research Association.","","Computer games; Education; Search engines; Social networking (online); Academic performance; Educational assessment; Educational computer game; Educational game; Educational gaming; Internet searches; Socio-demographic factors; Sociodemographic data; E-learning","","","","","","","Banilower E.R., Smith P.S., Weiss I.R., Malzahn K.A., Campbell K.M., Weis A.M., Report of the 2012 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education, (2013); Blumberg F.C., Blades M., Oates C., Youth and new }edia: The appeal and educationa| ramifications of digital game play for children and adolescents, Zeitschrift für Psychologie (Journal of Psychology, 221, 2, pp. 67-71, (2013); Boyle E.A., Connolly T.M., Hainey T., Boyle J.M., Engagement in digital entertainment games: A systematic review, Computers in Human Behavior, 28, 3, pp. 771-780, (2012); Bradley R.H., Corwyn R.F., Socioeconomic status and child development, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 1, pp. 371-399, (2002); ComScore Releases February 2013 U.S. Search Engine Rankings, (2013); Casey A., Layte R., Lyons S., Silles M., Home computer use and academic performance of nine-year-olds, Oxford Review of Education, 38, 5, pp. 617-634, (2012); Current Population Survey (CPS), Table 16, Number and Percentage of Persons 3 Years Old and over Using the Internet and Percentage Distribution by Means of Internet Access from Home and Main Reason for Not Having High-speed Access, (2011); Chapman L., Masters J., Pedulla J., Do digital divisions still persist in schools?

For many decades, the use of textbooks has been the traditional method of instruction; however, the emergence and implementation of teaching effectiveness assessment techniques has revealed that most students do not absorb the course content up to the expected level. As a result, many researchers have focused on advancing and improving the existing learning methods, as well as introducing and experimenting with new teaching styles. Unfortunately, researchers have been unable to agree on the effectiveness of the new teaching methods; consequently, they require further investigation. To address this problem, five innovative and effective teaching methods across all the engineering disciplines were selected (flipped classroom, gamification, design thinking/ case study, self-learning, and social media), and indepth content analyses of them were conducted. The advantages associated with each of the targeted new teaching method were explored, and data pertaining to teaching methods was identified and assessed. The results revealed that between the years of 2000 and 2017, the self-learning method and Social Media were researched and written about in journal articles significantly more often than other teaching methods. Most of the researchers distributed surveys/questionnaires to collect the data needed for the assessment of the adopted teaching techniques. It was concluded that adoption of Self-learning teaching method will improve research skills and thinking ability of learners. In addition, utilization of Social Media will increase effective communication among learners. The outcomes of this study have the potential to substantially help instructors, lecturers, and professors adopt the most effective teaching styles, based on their course learning objectives. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.","","","","","","","","","Kermanshachi S., Safapour E., Assessing students' higher education performance in minority and non-minority serving universities, Proceedings of Frontiers in Education (FIE), (2017);

Yet, amidst a growing body of teacher writing and a surge in digital media, there has emerged a new genre of teachers' public resignation letters, many of which go ""viral"" when posted online. This research is contextualized by literature on teacher attrition and neoliberalism and framed within theories of teacher agency and teacher resistance. Purpose: Within a context where the letters themselves are becoming more popular and the rates of teacher attrition continue to rise in troubling ways, this study explores a new genre by investigating the content and strategies employed in public resignation letters from teachers around the United States. Research Design: This research employed a qualitative design, drawing on methods of content analysis, to analyze 23 publicly available resignation letters. Conclusions: I argue that these letters represent a new form of public discourse. This discourse allows teachers to exercise their personal and professional agency in the form of resistance to dominant narratives about what public education is and should be and what current neoliberal reforms are doing to teachers and students. These among other reasons I uncovered through thematic coding are linked to contextual factors rather than individual ones, pointing to the limits of retention in a climate that does not support teachers' agency. Further, the majority of reasons for leaving are explicitly or implicitly tied to current neoliberal educational policies. According to their letters, teachers left the profession because (1) neoliberal reforms and policies threatened learning conditions and (2) these reforms had negative consequences for teachers' working conditions and beliefs. Specific neoliberal reforms and policies that were mentioned in the letters include: increased standardized testing and restrictions on curriculum, which teachers argued reflected a lack of care for students' socioemotional needs; decreasing pay/benefits; and punitive teacher evaluation systems. In addition, the consequences of these reforms meant that teachers felt: a lack of time, a mismatch between their beliefs and the reality of teaching in today's educational climate, and a lack of trust and respect for their profession, and a lack of control over their working conditions. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.","","","","","","","","","Abu-Lughod L., The romance of resistance.

This research is undertaken to reduce plagiarism in programming labs of universities across globe, faculty evaluation system development, and to remove social media use in labs. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Students of 21st century copy and exchange software codes available online with each other and at times even pay third-parties for timely submission of lab-assignments. They feel exchanging assignments with others maintain their social rapport/image among their friends. Our research initiated with Hawk-Eye that's a mobile based plagiarism detection system easy to handle and maintain. By further research we had observed that Hawk-Eye combination with Cohort-Intelligence (CI) would lead to design of more reliable plagiarism evaluation system. As Hawk's penetrating eyesight help in successful plagiarism detection and CI self-supervising nature helps to prevent students plagiarized behavior. Findings: The key motivation behind writing this paper is to highlight the fact that plagiarism in today's cyber age is contributing as a global business option in academic areas. So the design of evaluation systems in Universities should be flexible enough to lessen the overall incidence of plagiarism and motivating its students for not breaking University rules and regulations. Applications/Improvements: Hawk Eye along with CI would prove to be an efficient system to design an incrementally learning evaluation system as a measure in Universities to stop plagiarism that would continue to evolve every year with new semester.","CI; OCR; Optimization; Plagiarism; Tokenizing","","","","","","","","Puri K., Mulay P., Hawk Eye: A Plagiarism Detection Syste, Hyderabad, AISC Series of Springer: India: Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Computer and Communication Technologies (IC3T)., 379, pp. 195-203, (2015); Comparison of optical character recognition Software., Date accessed 28/01/2015; Cam Scanner -Phone PDF Creator.; Free Online OCR -Convert scanned PDF and Images to word, JPEG to Word.; Intelligent Character Recognition Software; Lukashenko R., Gradudina V., Grundspenkis J., Computer-Based Plagiarism Detection Methods and Tools: An Overview.

This chapter aims to explore, showcase and discuss how Web 2.0 tools can be integrated into teachers' classroom-based language assessment to get information that can be used diagnostically to adjust teaching and learning with reference to current literature, explore challenges and focus on suggestions and avenues for further research. Furthermore, examples of web tools that could be used for formative assessment will be briefly enlisted. © 2018 by IGI Global.

We argue that the social forces responsible for homophily-based selection are also at work with regard to homophily-based influence. We use data from the Flemish Educational Assessment Study, which collected complete network data from a representative sample of Flemish secondary school adolescents (N = 11,872). Results indicate that similarity on gender and ethnicity is linked with similarity on behavioural characteristics. Furthermore, the association between status homophily and behavioural homophily is stronger for boys than girls. For minorities, status heterophily on ethnicity is associated with behavioural heterophily, which may be an indication that minority students distance themselves from their majority-group friends. © 2015 SAGE Publications and Young Editorial Group.","adolescence; homophily; influence; school deviant behaviour; selection; social networks","","","","","","","","Aboud F.E., Mendelson M.J., Purdy K.T., Cross-race Peer Relations and Friendship Quality, International Journal of Behavioral Development, 27, 2, pp. 165-173, (2003); Agnew R., Pressured into Crime: An Overview of General Strain Theory, (2005); Akers R.L., Social Learning and Social Structure, (1998); Al-Methen A., Wilkinson W.J., Perceived Causes of Failure among Secondary School Students, Research in Education, 48, pp. 26-41, (1998); Anselin L., Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, (1988); Baerveldt C., Volker B., Van Rossem R., Revisiting Selection and Influence: An Inquiry into the Friendship Networks of High School Students and Their Association with Delinquency, Revue Canadienne de Criminologie et de Justice Pénale, Octobre, pp. 559-587, (2008); Billy J.O.G., Udry J.R., Patterns of Adolescent Friendship and Effects on Sexual Behavior, Social Psychology Quarterly, 48, 1, pp. 27-41, (1985); Bock E.W., Beeghley L., Mixon A.J., Religion, Socioeconomic-status, and Sexual Morality: An Application of Reference Group Theory, Sociological Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 545-559, (1983); Brutsaert H., Co-educatie: Studiekansen en kwaliteit van het schoolleven, (2001); Burt R.S., A Note on Missing Network Data in the General Social Survey, Social Networks, 9, 1, pp. 63-73, (1987); Demanet J., Van Houtte M., School Belonging and School Misconduct: Does Sense of Futility Clarify the Picture?, Sociological Spectrum, 31, 2, pp. 224-256, (2011); Elliott D.S., Menard S., Delinquency and Crime: Current Theories, pp. 28-67, (1996); Ennett S.T., Bauman K.E., The Contribution of Influence and Selection to Adolescent Peer Group Homogeneity: The Case of Adolescent Cigarette Smoking, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, 4, pp. 653-666, (1994); Erikson R., Goldthorpe J.H., Portocarero L., Intergenerational Class Mobility in 3 Western European Societies: England, France and Sweden, British Journal of Sociology, 30, 4, pp. 415-441, (1979); Festinger L., A Theory of Social Comparison Processes, Human Relations, 7, 2, pp. 117-140, (1954); Giordano P.C., Relationships in Adolescence, Annual Review of Sociology, 29, pp. 257-281, (2003); Hallinan M.T., The Structure of Positive Sentiments, (1974); Hallinan M.T., The Process of Friendship Formation, Social Networks, 1, 2, pp. 193-210, (1979); Haynie D.L., Osgood W.D., Reconsidering Peers and Delinquency: How Do Peers Matter?, Social Forces, 84, 2, pp. 1109-1130, (2005); Hirschi T., Causes of Delinquency, (1969); Houtzager B., Baerveldt C., Just like Normal: A Social Network Study of the Relation between Petty Crime and Intimacy of Adolescent Friendship, Social Behavior and Personality, 27, 2, pp. 117-192, (1999); Hox J., Multilevel Analysis: Techniques and Applications, (2002); Kandel D.B., The Parental and Peer Contexts of Adolescent Deviance: An Algebra of Interpersonal Influences, Journal of Drug Issues, 26, 2, pp. 289-315, (1996); Kao G., Joyner K., Do Race and Ethnicity Matter among Friends?

Although the situation itself is negative, it can be used by the principal to motivate the Superintendent to support his efforts to maintain student safety and combat the corresponding legal liability of 80 unsupervised students on school property. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-131769550-9; 978-113802098-6","","","English","Educational Leadersh. in Action: A Casebook for Aspiring Educational Leaders","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162722696"

However, the rapid and seemingly constant evolution of digital technology means that teachers face the problems of keeping pace with the technological changes within society, identifying which technologies are most suitable for use within education and adapting or creating pedagogies that suit these technologies. One technology that has significantly impacted education is the Internet and, more recently, the recent emergence of Web 2.0 technologies.

In particular, the research investigates how the academics went about improving students' 'learning engagement' and increasing 'learning challenge' through introducing 'new' online student experiences. Two case studies focus on the academics' professional learning and the support they sought for their own development and engagement, with the view to improving student learning. This will become increasingly important in the Australian higher education context, since from 2012 federal funding for higher education will follow students' course choices and will cease to be allocated to universities through quota systems. Teaching 'quality' is seen as a critical determinant of students' preferences and decision making. The motivation behind this policy and funding shift is to intensify market pressure to drive up 'quality' and responsiveness to consumer choices.

Thus, it is important for high school science teachers to be teaching current scientific methods. To update their skills high school teachers need to participate in professional development programs to update their own knowledge of current science research and techniques used in labs. Towards this goal, the John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawaii developed a professional development program for high school science teachers. In 2012, eight high school science teachers attended the program for eight week days over a two week period. This study is a report of the teachers’ experiences within the program. Specifically, this paper reports on the results of the teachers’ evaluation of the online materials and their perspectives of real world application of the learned material are investigated. The data set in this study includes all eight teachers’ pre-survey responses and final survey data. © 2012 Lisa van Raalte, Rachel Boulay, & Chris Campbell.","Blended learning; Educational technology; Online learning; Professional development","E-learning; Educational technology; Medicine; Professional aspects; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Blended learning; High school teachers; On-line materials; Online learning; Professional development; Professional development program; Scientific method; University of Hawaii; Teaching","","","","","U.S. Department of Education, (P336C050047)","","Andrewartha G., Wilmot S., Can multimedia meet tertiary educational needs better than the conventional lecture?

The Modern Educational Technology Center (METC) of East China Normal University (ECNU) decided to improve the course for pre-service teachers at the end of 2010. The enhanced course has some additional features, such as emphasising knowledge and skills transfer, adopting a 4C/ID model to improve the course content, focusing on common technologies as well as cutting-edge technologies, and creating a supportive learning environment by using an online platform. The METC piloted this course in the first semester of 2011. Feedback was collected from a tentative survey, the student teachers' evaluation of teaching, and their online reflections. The result indicated that the participants became more confident in designing micro e-learning courses and more interested in the field of educational technology after they completed this course. This paper describes the conceptual framework of the course, its new features, and the evaluation results.","","","","","","","","","Chen M., Research on innovation and practice of educational technology capabilities development model for student teachers, E-Education Research, Issue 3, 22-24, (2006); Cheng L., The study on educational technology capabilities development for student teachers, (2007); Dodge B., WebQuest taskonomy A taxonomy of tasks, (2002); Kennedy G.E., Judd T.S., Churchward A., Gray K., Krause K.-L., First year students' experiences with technology: Are they really digital natives, Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 24, 1, pp. 108-122, (2008); Educational technology competency standards for teachers (Trial), (2004); Tapscott D., Growing up digital The rise of the net generation, (1998); Van Merrienboer J.J.G., Clark R.E., De Croock M.B.M., Blueprints for complex learning: The 4C/ID model, Educational Technology Research and Development, 50, 2, pp. 39-61, (2002); Van Merrienboer J.J.G., Kester L., Whole task model in education, Handbook of research on educational communications and technology, pp. 442-446, (2007); Van Merrienboer J., Kirschner P.A., Four component instructional design (4C/ID), (2008); Zhang Q., Chen P., The problems and solutions in 'Intel teach to the future' for the normal university students, Journal of Educational Science of Hunan Normal University, Issue, 3, pp. 79-83, (2008); Zhao G., Research on educational technology capabilities development model for student teachers in higher education, China Teacher Human Resources Research in Higher Education, pp. 40-44, (2010)","H.

So, how to improve the quality of teaching methods has become an urgent issue (Vidovich, 2002). A closed-up multi-dimension monitoring system (CMMS) for teaching quality monitoring and management in an open and active way is proposed in this paper. The system illustrates that a self-evaluation and self-improving monitoring system for university education has the potential to enhance teaching quality and improve capacity-training of students. We have made innovative practices in teaching material construction, teaching content development, and students' assessment. We have also achieved some positive results in the innovations. The teaching monitoring method has the potential to be used to guide innovations in other subjects or programmes.

In order to do this it is important to understand backgrounds and attitudes, towards both academic and social life. The development of the Internet and social media has significantly influenced this quest. Although many discussions have developed about social media used in education institutions, very limited academic research has been done on interactive tools in learning design. Social media is rapidly changing the way people interact with each other. It provides higher education institutions opportunities for new levels of engagement with prospective students, alumni, donors, and community members. It also creates unique opportunities, and challenges, for connecting with the student community and for innovative teaching and learning. Many researchers argue that social media holds great potential for improving teaching and learning through creating student-centered learning; promoting collaboration among students; supporting individualized learning; providing an enjoyable learning experience; and enabling flexible learning schedules. With the growing interest in social media in education, an increasing yet still small number of academic studies on social media in higher education have been conducted. Teaching effectiveness has been investigated extensively in traditional classrooms for more than seven decades. But over the past years, research has become directed toward teaching effectiveness in online or virtual classes. The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of social media and the strategies for using it in a constructive way in U.S. and South Korean higher education. It aims to investigate the use of social media in the real settings of higher education to gain a deep understanding of the complexity of this issue. The study will define Chickering and Gamson's (1987) seven principles operationally in relationship to traditional and online classroom. Two theories, Bandura's (1977) Social Learning Theory and Vygotsky's (1978) Social Development Theory will be utilized to understand learning through social media. To make a meaningful impact on student learning, it is important that faculty understand the ""net generation"" students' changing values, needs, behaviors, and learning styles. Researchers propose that this new generation of students has shaped a culture of learning shifting from a teaching centered focus to student centered learning design which demands greater student engagement. This study will also identify how organizations are using technology and social media and how to teach students to use their technology skills to make positive contributions to society. A survey will gather data comparing student and faculty uses of Facebook and their perceptions of its utility as a classroom support tool in U.S. and South Korea. This survey will be implemented during the Spring 2012 semester, utilizing oncampus email accounts and a survey hosted on SurveyMonkey.com a commercial survey-hosting website.","Higher education; Seven principles of good education; Social development theory; Social learning theory; Social media","Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Surveys; Teaching; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Individualized learning; Social development; Social learning theory; Social media; Student-centered learning; Teaching effectiveness; Students","","","","","","","Bandura A., Social Learning Theory, (1977); Barkhaus L., Tshiro J., Student socialization in the age of facebook, Proceedings of the 28th Annual SIGCHI Conference on Human Facto5rs in Computing Systems, Atlanta, pp. 133-142, (2010); Bonk C., The Wider Open Learning World: Sea, Land, and Ice Views.

Most universities rely on summative evaluations conducted at the end of a term or course. A formative approach in which each course unit is evaluated may be beneficial for students and teachers but has rarely been applied. This is most probably due to the time constraints associated with various procedures inherent in formative evaluation (numerous evaluations, high amounts of aggregated data, high administrative investment). In order to circumvent these disadvantages, we chose the Web 2.0 Internet application Twitter as evaluation tool and tested whether it is useful for the implementation of a formative evaluation. After a first pilot and subsequent experimental study, the following conclusions were drawn: First, the formative evaluation did not come to the same results as the summative evaluation at the end of term, suggesting that formative evaluations tap into different aspects of course evaluation than summative evaluations do. Second, the results from an offline (i.e., paper-pencil) summative evaluation were identical with those from an online summative evaluation of the same course conducted a week later. Third, the formative evaluation did not influence the ratings of the summative evaluation at the end of the term. All in all, we can conclude that Twitter is a useful tool for evaluating a course formatively (i.e., on a weekly basis). Because of Twitter's simple use and the electronic handling of data, the administrative effort remains small. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2010.","","Adult; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Program Evaluation; Questionnaires; Students; Teaching; adult; article; education; female; health care quality; human; Internet; male; methodology; questionnaire; student; teaching","","","","","","","McKeachie W.J., Student ratings: The validity of use, American Psychologist, 52, pp. 1218-1225, (1997); Griffin B.W., Instructor reputation and student ratings of instruction, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 26, pp. 534-552, (2001); Gurung R.A.R., Vespia K.M., Looking good, teaching well?

DESIGN: Interactive digital images of drug products and a database of quiz questions pertaining to the products were created and an interactive online platform was designed. The interactive digital images were incorporated in pharmaceutics lectures as examples of dosage forms studied and calculations taught. The online quizzes were administered to first-professional year pharmacy students in fall 2004 and fall 2005. ASSESSMENT: The competency outcome data illustrates that the product-based online quizzes aided students in meeting the desired learning objectives. Modifications to increase ease of use resulted in higher student success rates in the second year of implementation. Student and faculty evaluations of the application were largely positive.

However, research indicates that student response rates for online course evaluation are low, and that the few students who do comply are motivated due to greatly disliking or liking an aspect of the course. In this paper, we address the issues surrounding low student response rates, and one potential method to increase these rates. After reviewing the importance of student evaluation, some of the solutions that have been previously offered and the issue of instructor bias, we offer a potential solution to increase response rates for online course evaluation. We performed a small-scale study, whereby online instructors either conducted ""standard"" practice, (i.e., a prescribed written message posted on the homepage of each online course), personal e-mail to students about the importance of feedback, or personal short video message, also on the importance of feedback, that was then posted on the homepage of the course. At the time of writing, our institution has just closed the window for course evaluations, and we are unable to report on the results of our intervention. However, we predict the video condition will yield the largest increase in response rates, as the students directly see the instructor who is soliciting feedback. The e-mail condition should yield increased response rates, albeit lower than in the video condition, but still in excess of the prescribed message from our institution. If so, we will conclude that instructors do not need to provide extra course credit or withhold grades in order to solicit feedback. Instead, instructors must increase the feeling of being a member of a learning community, with the importance of feedback clearly outlined.","Course evaluation return rate; Course evaluations; Evaluations; Instructor evaluations; Online evaluations; Participation rates; Response rates; Student evaluations","Education; Electronic mail; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Students; Surveys; Course evaluations; Evaluations; Instructor evaluations; On-line evaluation; Participation rate; Response rate; Student evaluation; E-learning","","","","","","","Anderson H.M., Cain J., Bird E., Online student course evaluations: Review of literature and a pilot study, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 69, 1, pp. 34-43, (2005); Bean L.H., Effects of the social circumstances surrounding the rating situation on students' evaluations of faculty, Teaching of Psychology, 4, 5, pp. 200-202, (1978); Dommeyer C.J., Baum P., Hanna R., College students' attitudes towards methods of collecting teaching evaluations: In-class versus online, Journal of Education for Business, 1, 78, pp. 11-15, (2002); Ernst D., Student evaluations: a comparison of online vs. paper data collection, (2006); Johnson T., Online student ratings: Will students respond?, (2002); Higgins T., Erffmeyer R., Exploring Online Course Evaluation Response Rates, (2010); Waters M., Kemp E., Pucci A., High and low faculty evaluations: Descriptions by students, Teaching of Psychology, 4, 15, pp. 203-204, (1988)","","Levinsen K.T.; Orngreen R.","Academic Conferences Limited","","13th European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL 2014","30 October 2014 through 31 October 2014","Copenhagen","108962","20488637","978-191030967-4","","","English","Proc.

It is supported by ontological structures related to science education based on active consent of specific communities of practice. It allows selecting and incorporating the ontologies in order to organize learning objects to improve learning process. It is created as a setting in which they had the relevant formal descriptions (coding ontology) and informal (and narrative contextualization of concepts); where the possible intra-and inter-community relations were made explicit and recognized by all participants through specific social software. The last point in particular, has led to our hypothesis: only the transition from a technology-driven model (formal, static) to a community-driven model (dynamic and integrated in an open learning environment) could make really effective and relevant the ontologies that we built in several communities of practice. Therefore, the final goal was the realization of an integrated learning environment attempting the difficult transition from an “ontological-formal” system to an “ontological-relational” one. © 2015, Giunti.

In order todo this it is important to understand backgrounds and attitudes, towards both academic and social life. The development of the Internet and social media has significantly influenced this quest. Although many discussions have developed aboutsocial media used in education institutions, very limited academic research has been done on interactive tools in learning design. Social media is rapidly changing the way people interact with each other. It provides higher education institutions opportunities for new levels of engagement with prospective students, alumni, donors, and community members. It also creates unique opportunities, and challenges, for connecting with the student community and for innovative teaching and learning. Many researchers argue that social media holds great potential for improving teaching and learning throughcreating student-centered learning; promoting collaboration among students; supporting individualized learning; providing an enjoyable learning experience; and enabling flexible learning schedules. With the growing interest in social media in education, an increasing yet still small number of academic studies on social media in higher education have been conducted. Teaching effectiveness has been investigated extensively in traditional classrooms for more than seven decades. But over the past years, research has become directed toward teaching effectiveness in online or virtual classes. The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of social media and the strategies for using it in a constructive way in U.S. and South Korean higher education. It aims to investigate the use of social media in the real settings of higher education to gain a deep understanding of the complexity of this issue. The study will define Chickering and Gamson's (1987) seven principles operationally in relationship to traditional and online classroom. Two theories, Bandura's (1977) Social Learning Theory and Vygotsky's (1978) Social Development Theory will be utilized to understand learning through social media. To make a meaningful impact on student learning, it is important that faculty understand the ""net generation"" students' changing values, needs, behaviors, and learning styles. Researchers propose that this new generation of students has shaped a culture of learning shifting from a teaching centered focus to student centered learning design which demands greater student engagement. This study will also identify how organizations are using technology and social media and how to teach students to use their technology skills to make positive contributions to society. A survey will gatherdata comparing student and faculty uses of Facebook and their perceptions of its utility as a classroom support tool in U.S. and South Korea. This survey will be implemented during the Spring 2012 semester, utilizing oncampus email accountsand a survey hosted on SurveyMonkey.com a commercial survey-hosting website.","Higher education; Seven principles of good education; Social development theory; Social learning theory; Social media","Economic and social effects; Government data processing; Research; Social networking (online); Surveys; Teaching; Academic research; Classroom support; Education institutions; Facebook; Faculty use; Higher education; Higher education institutions; Innovative teaching; Interactive tool; Learning designs; Learning experiences; Learning schedule; Learning Style; Online classroom; Social development; Social learning theory; Social life; Social media; South Korea; Student engagement; Student learning; Student-centered learning; Teaching and learning; Teaching effectiveness; Technology skills; University students; Virtual class; Vygotsky; Students","","","","","","","Bandura A., Social Learning Theory, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, (1977); Barkhaus L., Tshiro J., Student Socialization in the Age of Facebook, Proceedings of the 28th Annual SIGCHI Conference on Human Facto5rs in Computing Systems, pp. 133-142, (2010); Bonk C., The Wider Open Learning World: Sea, Land, and Ice Views.

The chapter explains Dr. OsGood’s incompetence at appropriately directing and communicating with staff has allowed a dysfunctional staff culture to develop. Osgood has polarized the staff into a divided inner circle that does not have appropriate working relationships or boundaries, and an outer circle that is uncertain of what they should be working on because of poor communication. The outer circle is clearly frustrated because of the lack of direction, differential treatment and exclusion from important decision-making processes. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis","","","","","","","978-131769550-9; 978-113802098-6","","","English","Educational Leadersh. in Action: A Casebook for Aspiring Educational Leaders","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162709818"

Several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered leading to targeted professional growth of an organization to evaluate the performance, such as acquiring research grants, research profile, student evaluation, publications, academic responsibilities etc. However, to quantify such information is a difficult task. Usually standard 'Key Performance Indicators' (KPIs) are used to evaluate bare level workload of a faculty, however gauging quality always remain a challenge. In this paper, we propose an ontology based faculty performance evaluation system where the ontology is used to conceptualize the qualitative factors of the faculty as well as the set of rules that together make a system. The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is used to represent rules in ontology and built-in reasoning support help to deduce new knowledge. The presented work has been tested by applying it on real data set of a Public Sector University in Pakistan, and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed system. It must be mentioned that the use of ontology makes the system easily modifiable due to the availability of the sophisticated ontology editors and APIs as well as provides complete automatic system. © 2014 IEEE.","Faculty evaluation; Ontology; Performance management system; Quality of service; Semantic web","Benchmarking; Ontology; Quality of service; Semantic Web; Social networking (online); Faculty evaluation; Key performance indicators; Ontological approach; Performance evaluation system; Performance management systems; Professional growth; Quantitative factors; Semantic Web Rule Language(SWRL); Quality control","","","","","","","Taylor Huber M., Faculty evaluation and the development of academic careers, New Dir.

It is supported by ontological structures related to science education based on active consent of specific communities of practice. It allows selecting and incorporating the ontologies in order to organize learning objects to improve learning process. It is created as a setting in which they had the relevant formal descriptions (coding ontology) and informal (and narrative contextualization of concepts), where the possible intra-and inter-community relations were made explicit and recognized by all participants through specific social software. The last point in particular, has led to our hypothesis: only the transition from a technology-driven model (formal, static) to a community-driven model (dynamic and integrated in an open learning environment) could make really effective and relevant the ontologies that we built in several communities of practice. Therefore, the final goal was the realization of an integrated learning environment attempting the difficult transition from an 'ontological-formal' system to an 'ontological-relational' one. © 2014 IEEE.","Learning; Ontologies; Semantic representation; Web 2.0","Computer aided instruction; Public relations; Semantic Web; Semantics; Communities of Practice; Community relations; Domain-specific ontologies; Educational assessment; Learning; Ontological structures; Semantic representation; Web 2.0; Ontology","","","","","","","Stutt A., Motta E., Semantic learning webs, Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 10, (2004); Aroyo L., Dicheva D., The new challenges for e-learning: The educational semantic web, Educational Technology &Society, 7, 4, pp. 59-69, (2004); Koper R., Olivier B., Representing the learning design of units of learning educational, Technology &Society, 7, 3, pp. 97-111, (2004); Galliani L., Petrucco C., Dal Bon C., EduOnto: Actors, processes, technologies: An ontology on educational acting, Conference Proceedings 21st ICDE World Conference on Open Learning and Distance, (2004); Studer R., Et al., Knowledge engineering: Principles and methods, Data Knowledge Engineering, 25, 1-2, pp. 161-197, (1998); Braun S., Schmidt A.P., Walter A., Nagypal G., Zacharias V., Ontology Maturing: A Collaborative Web 2. 0 Approach to Ontology Engineering, (2007); Galliani (eds) L., Web Ontology della Valutazione Educativa, (2009); Souzis A., Building a semantic wiki, IEEE Intelligent Systems, 20, 5, pp. 87-91, (2005); Wenger E., Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning and Identity, (1998); Ure J., Procter R., Lin Y., A socio-technical perspective on ontology development in healthgrids, Proceedings of UK EScience All Hands Meeting, (2007); Brown J.S., Collins A., Duguid P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning, Educational Researcher, 18, 1, pp. 32-41, (1989); Mathes A., Folksonomies-cooperative classification and communication through shared metadata, Computer Mediated Communication, 47, 10, pp. 1-13, (2004); Notti A.M., Valutazione Educativa: Sperimentazione dell'Ontologia, (2009); Le Boterf G., Construire les Compétences Individuelles et Collectives, (2000)","","Xhafa F.; Koeppen M.; Palmieri F.; Loia V.; Barolli L.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","6th International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems, IEEE INCoS 2014","10 September 2014 through 12 September 2014","Salerno","111581","","978-147996386-7","","","English","Proc. - Int.

To gain a better understanding of the intricacies of CTC, a detailed study has commenced. The study includes a diverse mix of institutions including the University of Washington, Minnesota State University, Tuskegee University, Seattle Pacific University and Simmons College. Evaluation of CTC in STEM fields at this diverse mix of institutions will provide insight into some of the complex factors that affect CTC such as faith and worldview, ethnicity, gender, academic communities of practice, social networks, faculty-student ratios, teaching quality, and others. CTC, as well as their mediators and confounding influences, are studied using a mixed methods approach that includes surveys, semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Qualitative methods, including ethnographic study, are used to understand the experiences of under-represented minorities at institutions where statistically significant sample sizes are not possible. This paper focuses on the conceptual framework that ties CTC to key outcomes and qualities of STEM education and the surveys used to measure many of the constructs in the conceptual framework. The survey items for many constructs have been validated in previous research efforts in K-12 education and higher education; however, experience has shown that use of these assessment tools in STEM education necessitates their modification, reliability reevaluation, and revalidation to maintain accurate assessment of research questions. From this study will come both a conceptual model for understanding the relationships between CTC and their mediating and confounding factors, and a restructured assessment tool that can be used in STEM education to evaluate many of the affective inputs and behavioral outputs that ultimately correlate to short, moderate, and long term academic outcomes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.","","Education computing; Engineering education; Quality control; Societies and institutions; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Surveys; Teaching; Academic performance; Conceptual frameworks; Minnesota State University; Qualitative method; Semi structured interviews; Student engagement; Underrepresented minorities; University of Washington; Education","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (0909817)","","Goodenow C., Classroom belonging among early adolescent students: Relationships to motivation and achievement, Journal of Early Adolescence, 13, pp. 21-43, (1993); Goodenow C., The psychological sense of school membership among adolescents: Scale development and educational correlates, Psychology in Schools, 30, pp. 79-90, (1993); Ryan A.M., Patrick H., The classroom social environment and changes in adolescents' motivation and engagement during middle school, American Educational Research Journal, 38, 2, pp. 437-460, (2001); Dropout Rates in the United States - 1992, (1993); Brainard S.G., Carlin L., A six-year longitudinal study of undergraduate women in engineering and science, Journal of Engineering Education, 87, 4, pp. 369-375, (1998); Kraemer B.A., The academic and social integration of Hispanic students into college, Review of Higher Education, 20, 2, pp. 163-179, (1997); Tinto V., Dropout from higher education: A theoretical synthesis of recent research, Review of Educational Research, 45, pp. 89-125, (1975); Tinto V., Leaving College: Rethinking the Causes and Cures of Student Attrition, (1987); Tinto V., Leaving College: Rethinking the Causes and Cures of Student Attrition, (1993); DeNeui D.L.C., An investigation of first-year college students' psychological sense of community on campus, College Student Journal, 37, pp. 224-234, (2003); Liebler J., McConnell C., Management Principles for Health Care Professionals, (2004); Lee L., Wilson D., Empowering the engineering undergraduate in an Era of economic globalization, Frontiers in Education Conference, (2005); Lee L., Wilson D., The impact of affective and relational factors on classroom experience and career outlook among first-year engineering undergraduates, Frontiers in Education Conference, (2006); Wilson D., Jones Y., Integrated service learning on the gulf coast in the Hurricane Katrina aftermath, Frontiers in Education Conference, (2007); Wilson D., Does it matter? psychological sense of community and belonging in engineering education, Frontiers in Education Conference, (2008); Wilson D., Spring D., Hansen L., Experiences of engineering students in post- Katrina service learning programs, Frontiers in Education Conference, (2008); Anderson-Butcher D., Conroy D.E., Factorial and criterion validity of scores of a measure of belonging in youth development programs, Educational Psychology and Measurement, 62, pp. 857-876, (2002); Baumeister R., Leary M., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 17, 3, pp. 497-529, (1995); Astin A., What Matters in College?: Four Critical Years Revisited, (1993)","","","American Society for Engineering Education","","2010 ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition","20 June 2010 through 23 June 2010","Louisville, KY","81438","21535965","","","","English","ASEE Annu.

We will show how much the language can affect the learning process and how motivation and what kind of motivation can help a student to pass a course faster. Also, the meaning of social networks is discussed. The study was done in an electronics laboratory course in Aalto University, Finland, and in Rigas Technical University, Latvia, during the spring term in 2011. The course was taught for the first time in English in both universities and for the first time ever in Rigas Technical University. All students in this study volunteers to participate and this course is not a part of their normal bachelor degree program. As is well known, studying in English is very different from studying in one's native language for most people. Many students feel that they are still learning the language used in a course and also need to learn the substance at the same time. [1] All students taking part in the laboratory course both, in Finland and Latvia, were interviewed at the beginning and at the end of the course. Exchange students evaluated their own language skills in English evenly with a grade 3-5 of 5. While being interviewed, all exchange students were fluent in English and a teacher evaluated their language skills higher than the students did themselves. Some Latvian students thought their language skills were very low and barely acceptable to take a course in English. They were unsure if they could follow a lecture or read assignment handouts. Also their skills in English were evaluated higher by a teacher. The Latvian students evaluated their language skills with a grade 3.64 when they started the course but the same students had an average value of 3.82 when they completed the course. The exchange students evaluated their language skills with a grade 4.00 before the course but the grade was as high as 4.50 when they evaluated it after the course. If comparing the results before and after the courses, it can be seen that the students underestimated their language skills at least a little bit. They did not have difficulties passing the course as a result of the language. When doing self-evaluation about their own background knowledge of electronics, the Latvian students had a grade of 3.55 on average. After the course the average value was exactly the same. As discussed earlier in this paper, the Latvian students passed the course easily but they were a bit unsure about their level of skill in electronics. The exchange students were more self-confident at the beginning of the course. They estimated their own background knowledge in electronics to have a grade of 3.67. As mentioned earlier, it took much longer for them to finish all of the assignments compared to the Latvian students and compared to the reference group. At least the exchange students were honest when having the after course interview because they estimated their background skills in electronics to be 3.17.","Motivation; Non-native language; Social network","Computational linguistics; Education; Learning systems; Motivation; Social networking (online); Teaching; Back-ground knowledge; Electronics laboratories; Exchange students; Laboratory course; Learning process; Non-native language; Self evaluation; Technical universities; Students","","","","","","","Lowes L., Peters H., Turner M., The International Student's Guide: Studying in English at University, pp. 20-22, (2004); Dalton-Puffer C., Nikula T., Smit U., Language use and Language Learning in CLIL Classrooms, pp. 237-247, (2010); Healy T., Work in Progress: Curiosity in the Education of the Engineer, pp. 6-7, (2004); Dong Y.R., Non-native graduate students' thesis/dissertation writing in science: Self-reports by students and their advisors from two U.

Research methods courses - when developed by faculty members and librarian/instructional technologists - can move beyond database navigation and PowerPoint presentations when incorporating social media. This chapter discusses two Information Literacy case studies, one for a junior seminar in the hard sciences and the second for a class on the history of African-American Mathematicians. The courses were developed at a private, four-year Historically Black College/University (HBCU) through a faculty/library collaboration. These classes used a variety of Web 2.0 and social media tools including Google Maps, Flickr, Delicious, Yahoo Pipes,Meebo, YouTube, iTunes U, and the Moodle Learning Management System. Each case study will define and describe how each tool was used and the collaboration between faculty and librarians/technologists to implement social media. Student and faculty assessment of the program as well as anecdotal evidence is discussed for each study and implementation tips are provided. These case studies provide the practitioner ways to create an interactive, collaborative learning experience for students and faculty while alleviating library anxiety.

This phenomenon is more than print journals going online. The options available with new low-cost online publishing software and the rise in the ability to use ratings from user generated content suggest more near-term changes are likely. Many of the outcomes are unsettled: the economics of online publishing; the standards for peer review, rank, and tenure; and the very nature of scholarly publishing itself. What is certain, however, is that the economics of online academic publishing - modeled via Anderson's Long Tail Theory - will make it possible to provide greater access, more collaboration, and, ultimately, improved research and researchers. Universities acting as publishing centers with their e-reserves will be expected to change their faculty evaluations, providing greater academic rewards for those who act as editors, reviewers, and proofreaders within this new born-online and only-online world. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Academic rank and tenure; Anderson; Collaboration; E-reserves; Editorial boards; Long Tail Theory; Online academic publishing; Peer bias; Peer review; Ratings; Software; University library; User generated content","","","","","","European Commission","• SOPS.

In the current stage of the Circuit Theory course transformation, the authors focus on the student evaluation of the course, and the students' opinion on perspective modification of the course; in particular, on application of various Internet tools (Social Networks, Virtual Worlds, RSS Feeds etc.) for teaching. The survey results show that our students are satisfied with the teaching quality; they indicate insufficient workload as the main examination failure reason. In students' opinion, lecture and classroom tutorials video podcasts are the most successful method of increasing teaching efficiency. The students' acceptance of modern Internet tools for teaching is rather low, the only exception is the Learning Management System (LMS). Following the survey results, the authors reject the idea of introducing more Internet tools for teaching; they will focus on delivering more video podcasts, stimulating students' activity and motivation, as well as increasing application of LMS for self-learning and communication.","Advanced technology in education and training; Course transformation; Distance and open education; Internet tools for teaching; Technology - based blended","Circuit theory; Communication; Engineering education; Information technology; RSS; Social networking (online); Surveys; Teaching; Virtual reality; Advanced technology in education and training; Course transformation; Information and Communication Technologies; Internet tools; Knowledge delivery; Learning management system; Podcasts; RSS feeds; Self-learning; Social Networks; Student evaluation; Teaching quality; Undergraduate Courses; University of Technology; Virtual worlds; Students","","","","","","","Rutkowski J., Moscinska K., ICT supported engineering course - Case study and guidelines,  Int.

One of the most important tools employed during this process is language. In this paper we take exploratory dialogue, a joint form of co-reasoning, to be an external indicator that learning is taking place. Using techniques developed within the field of computational linguistics, we build on previous work using cue phrases to identify exploratory dialogue within online discussion. Automatic detection of this type of dialogue is framed as a binary classification task that labels each contribution to an online discussion as exploratory or non-exploratory. We describe the development of a self-training framework that employs discourse features and topical features for classification by integrating both cue-phrase matching and k-nearest neighbour classification. Experiments with a corpus constructed from the archive of a two-day online conference show that our proposed framework outperforms other approaches. A classifier developed using the self-training framework is able to make useful distinctions between the learning dialogue taking place at different times within an online conference as well as between the contributions of individual participants. © 2013 ACM.","computational linguistics; cue-phrase matching; discourse analytics; educational assessment; educational dialogue; exploratory dialogue; k-nearest neighbour; learning analytics; MaxEnt; self-training framework; social learning; social learning analytics; SocialLearn; synchronous dialogue","Computational linguistics; cue-phrase matching; discourse analytics; Educational assessment; educational dialogue; exploratory dialogue; K-nearest neighbours; learning analytics; MaxEnt; Self-training; Social learning; SocialLearn; synchronous dialogue; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","Open Learning Analytics: An Integrated & Modularized Platform, (2011); Sfard A., On two metaphors for learning and the dangers of choosing just one, Educational Researcher, 27, 2, pp. 4-13, (1998); Goodman P.S., L A.D., Methodological issues in measuring group learning, Small Group Research, 42, 4, pp. 379-404, (2011); Koch J., Does distance learning work?

The aim is to increase the motivation of the lecturers involved, so that better performance can be achieved, and the teaching-learning process enriched. Design/methodology/approach - Three complementary performance measures are used: students' active participation; lecturers' personal reflections; and lecturer peer-to-peer assessment. Findings - These tools have provided the teaching staff with information about their strengths and weaknesses, as a consequence of which they have learned to deploy their skills inside the classroom and prepare their subjects more effectively. In this way, it is shown that the public teaching system can assess the potential of its human resources, and increase their motivation.

In terms of the recording of search portfolios, none of them is complete. Taking the above understanding into consideration, this study aims at using the learning portfolio records of internet searching in hopes of setting up an online learning system that can ""comprehensively record,"" ""completely share,"" and ""actively present,"" the learning portfolio. This system should also offer us a chance at seeing how students' personal searching capability is influenced after observing others' search portfolios, and thus provide educators who are interested in internet searching education with a learning platform on which in-depth understanding of student's comprehensive internet searching behavior is offered and evaluations and analyses are performed. Subjects of this research are fourth grade primary school students. It is proven by the experiment that no matter the teacher or the student, they all can record the complete search process and observe others' portfolio data in full. For teachers, they can explore students' search behavior in a more complete sense. For students, it is proven by experiment result analysis that observation-based learning of search portfolio results is helpful for students' collaborative knowledge construction.","Collaborative knowledge construction; Observation-based learning; Web 2.0","Experiments; Information retrieval; Knowledge management; Search engines; Students; Telecommunication networks; User interfaces; Web services; Collaborative knowledge; Complete search; Concept-based; In-depth understanding; Internet searches; Internet searching; Learning platform; Learning portfolio; Observation-based learning; Online learning systems; Primary schools; Result analysis; Search behavior; Search capabilities; Searching capability; Web 2.0; Internet","","","","","","","Hwang G.-J., Tsai P.-S., Tsai C.-C., Tseng J.C.R., A novel approach for assisting teachers in analyzing student web-searching behaviors, Comput.

Wiki software in particular is useful in the process of education for building independent learning spaces to which students contribute, and it supports the social aspects of the teaching/learning process. The communicative features of wiki are the subject of the research regarding the added value of e-learning compared to traditional goals stated in educational theories. The article begins by briefly reviewing this Web 2.0 tool in terms of its educational potential. It presents a case study of HE e-learning courses where the technical properties of different environments in Web 2.0 are linked to the specific need for an interdisciplinary approach to education for sustainable development. The educational objectives of the course are closely linked to the specific character of sustainable development (which is considered to be a social process based on multi-stakeholder communication rather than the sum of diverse political activities) and critical social theory, particularly the theory of communicative action which has emancipatory consequences for those involved. In the educational sphere, these goals are supported by the selection of ""group oriented software"" which promotes creativity in the context of academic writing on diverse themes. This supports action competence development and provides diverse communication opportunities which foster students' relationship building. The complex aim of the learning project presented in the article is the building of an extensive educational wiki electronic encyclopedia by students' contributions, through their collaboration on diverse environmental subjects. This learning space provides a knowledge base of easily accessible information for students' different assignments and practical work and is designed to support individual expression; by their contribution to this learning environment students feel part of the knowledge generation community. Contributions are evaluated according to their quality and pages are allocated varying statuses expressed by the level of copyright-some can be continuously upgraded by specialists or by new generations of students. The communicative aspect of learning is easy to trace in the wiki ""discussion"" option and can be mapped in the history of the page; thus qualitative evaluation is possible. Aspects such as flexibility in selecting the learning strategy and a creative approach present a real challenge for assessment, widely discussed in the literature. A peer review process conducted by students themselves and the quality of their discussion combined with the teacher's assessment is proposed as a contribution to this discussion. Students' interest in active work in the interactive electronic environment was investigated and positive results received. High quality results in terms of students' portfolios (essays and review discussions) provide evidence of usability of the presented pedagogical tool at university level. The article concludes with a review of our experiences with MediaWiki, useful for those interested in utilizing it as an educational tool. The use of electronic media and its potential link to the theory of communicative action in the educational context is briefly reflected upon.","Communicative aspect of e-learning; Environmental Education; MediaWiki; Online social space","Communication; Computer aided instruction; Computer software; E-learning; Economic and social effects; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Planning; Quality control; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Teaching; Web services; Competence development; Education for sustainable development; Educational objectives; Electronic environments; Environmental education; MediaWiki; Qualitative evaluations; Social spaces; Students","","","","","","","Allen J., Ramaekers G., Van Der Velden R., Measuring competencies of higher education graduates, Enhancing Alumni Research: European and American Perspectives, New Directions for Institutional Research, 126, pp. 49-59, (2005); Anderson L.W., Krathwohl D.R., Et al., A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, (2000); Bandura A., Social Learning Theory, (1977); Berkhout F., Leach M., Scoones I., Negotiating Environmental Change: New Perspectives from Social Science, (2003); Bloom B.S., Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, Handbook I: The Cognitive Domain, (1956); Clark D.R., Learning Domains or Bloom's Taxonomy, (2004); Dlouha J., Machackova Henderson L., E-learning as an opportunity for virtual mobility and competence development within european universities, The Proceedings of the 7th European Conference on E-Learning (ECEL), pp. 297-307, (2008); Dlouha J., Networking European Universities Through E-learning, 3, (2008); Dlouha J., EnviWiki - The Czech Multimedia Toolkit for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), 3, (2008); Definition and Selection of Competencies, (2005); Downes S., E-learning 2.0, ELearn Magazine, (2005); Inventory of Innovative Practices in Education for Sustainable Development, (2008); Key competences for lifelong learning.

The project draws on some aspects of collaborative learning to ensure that a rich virtual learning environment is created for learners. Working closely with teachers in their facilitator role, we assist schools and learners from different countries, backgrounds to share their experiences and tackle difficult questions on Connecting Worlds. In this paper, we share our experiences incorporating South African schools on this platform. Through an open ended questionnaire, teachers evaluated the 2010 edition of Connecting World in South African schools on climate change. The teachers also participated in a focus group discussion. From the findings, issues of time, language and technical problems were prominent.","Climate change; Collaborative learning; Connecting worlds","Climate change; Computer aided instruction; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Collaborative learning; Connecting worlds; Focus groups; Global citizenship; Online platforms; Open-ended questionnaire; Virtual learning environments; E-learning","","","","","","","Smith B., MacGregor J., What is collaborative learning?, Collaborative Learning: A Sourcebook for Higher Education, pp. 9-22, (1992); Golub J., Focus on Collaborative Learning, (1988); (2011); Education for Global Citizenship: A Guide for Schools, (2006); Herskovitz J., Rural Schools from Apartheid Cloud South Africa's Future, (2010); Farrell G., Isaacs S., Survey of ICT and Education in Africa: A Summary Report Based on 53 Country Surveys, (2007); NEIMS Report, (2009); Conway-Smith E., In South Africa, attending school in a mud hut, Independent Education, (2011); Bond P., Townships, International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, (2008); Hourcade H.J.P., Bullock-Rest N.E., Schelhowe H., Digital technologies and marginalized youth, Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children (IDC '10), pp. 360-363, (2010); Amstrong P., Teacher pay in South Africa: How attractive is the teaching profession, Stellenbosch Economic Working Papers: 04/09, (2009); Mitra S., Minimally invasive education: A progress report on the 'Hole in the wall' experiments, The British Journal of Educational Technology, 34, 3, pp. 367-371, (2003); Cambridge G., Minimally invasive education, digital doorways and smart cards, The Smartcard Society Conference, (2003); Dangwal R., Jha S., Kapur P., Impact of minimally invasive education on children: An Indian perspective, British Journal of Education Technology, 37, 2, (2005); Dalvit L., Tsietsie M., Mapi T., Sam M., Maseko P., Terzoli A., The localisation into isiXhosa of iLanga, a VoIP PBX,  Annual International Conference on Computing and ICT Research (SREC-2008), (2008); Dalvit L., Maseko P., Nosilela B., Mapi T., Sam M., Terzoli A., Bailey D., The first translate@thon at rhodes: Localising horde/Imp into isiXhosa,  Annual Conference on WWW Applications, (2008); Brandt I., Hodgkinson-Williams C., Terzoli A., Wireless communications in previously disadvantaged secondary schools in grahamstown South Africa, Conference Presentation Accepted for the 10th Annual Tech International Conference and Exposition, (2005); Sieborger I., Terzoli A., Hodgkinson-Williams C., The development of ICT networks for South African schools: Two pilot studies in disadvantaged areas, Learning to Live in the Knowledge Society, 281, pp. 167-170, (2008)","","","","","4th International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-Line Learning, eL and mL 2012","30 January 2012 through 4 February 2012","Valencia","102335","23084367","978-161208180-9","","","English","eLmL - Int.

Prior research suggests that social, collaborative learning environments are best suited for improving language ability. However, opportunities for English learners to collaboratively practice reading comprehension are minimal, and due to resource constraints and a lack of accurate evaluation methods, English instructors rarely assess student literacy effectively. In response to these problems, we propose a Tag-based Collaborative reading learning System (TACO) that makes use of Web 2.0 Internet social tagging techniques to provide a collaborative environment for reading English. We test our system's ability to both improve reading comprehension and aid teachers in accurately assessing literacy by conducting a three-month trial with 56 participating Taiwanese high school students from February to May 2009. During this period, post-testing results show a significant improvement in reading scores among participants in our tag-based system, and survey feedback from teachers suggests an improved capacity for literacy assessment. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing from business and higher education literature, trends on cross-border digital service delivery are analysed. Through a content analysis of recent strategic or corporate plans of Australian and United Kingdom universities, predictions are made about how these strategic priorities might create future challenges and opportunities for university educators and administrators. Internationalisation plans from Australian universities are also used to better understand whether e-Learning is prioritised as a current or future mode of internationalisation. Strategic and technological responses are discussed to help overcome challenges such as the trade-off between teaching quality and profitability which will become more significant as online cohorts expand. © 2013 Mark Tayar.","e-Learning; International business; Internationalisation; Online learning","E-learning; Economic and social effects; Social networking (online); Content analysis; Digital services; Future challenges; Higher education; International business; Internationalisation; Online learning; Teaching quality; Education","","","","","","","Transnational education in the higher education sector, Research Snapshot Series, (2011); International student data 2013, Data and Research, (2013); Altbach P.G., Knight J., The internationalization of higher education: Motivations and realities, Journal of Studies in International Education, 11, 3-4, (2007); Baark E., Engineering consultancy: An assessment of IT-enabled international delivery of services, Technology Analysis & Strategic Management, 11, 1, pp. 55-74, (1999); Berthon P., Pitt L., Katsikeas C.S., Berthon J.P., Virtual services go international: International services in the marketspace, Journal of International Marketing, pp. 84-105, (1999); Bradmore D.J., Smyrnios K.X., The writing on the wall: Responses of Australian public universities to competition in global higher education, Higher Education Research & Development, 28, 5, pp. 495-508, (2009); Crofts K., Bisman J., Interrogating accountability: An illustration of the use of Leximancer software for qualitative data analysis, Qualitative Research in Accounting & Management, 7, 2, pp. 180-207, (2010); Broader implications from a downturn in international students, (2011); Harley D., Planning for an uncertain future: A US perspective on why accurate predictions about ICTs may be difficult, Journal of Studies in International Education, 6, 2, pp. 172-187, (2002); Harman G., New directions in internationalizing higher education: Australia's development as an exporter of higher education services, Higher Education Policy, 17, 1, pp. 101-120, (2004); ""International Education – Global Growth and Prosperity."", (2013); Kellogg S., Distance learning: Online education, Nature, 478, pp. 417-418, (2011); Knight J., Internationalization remodeled: Definition, approaches, and rationales, Journal of Studies in International Education, 8, 1, (2004); ""Our Plan: Real solutions for all Australians."", (2013); Mazzarol T., Soutar G.N., Seng M.S.Y., The third wave: Future trends in international education, International Journal of Educational Management, 17, 3, pp. 90-99, (2003); Moodie G., Coalition's big ideas shake up boundaries, The Australian, (2013); Morgan-Thomas A., Bridgewater S., Internet and exporting: Determinants of success in virtual export channels, International Marketing Review, 21, 4-5, pp. 393-408, (2004); Parker L., Winners and losers, In the black, (2011); Patterson L.M., Carrillo P.B., Salinas R.S., Lessons From a Global Learning Virtual Classroom, Journal of Studies in International Education, 16, 2, pp. 182-197, (2012); Smith A.E., Humphreys M.S., Evaluation of unsupervised semantic mapping of natural language with Leximancer concept mapping, Behavior Research Methods, 38, 2, pp. 262-279, (2006); Tayar M., Jack R., Prestige orientated market entry – the case of Australian universities, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, 35, 2, pp. 153-166; Welch L.S., Luostarinen R., Internationalization: Evolution of a concept, The Internationalization of the firm, pp. 83-98, (1988); Whyte S., Unis hit by foreign student brain drain, The Sydney Morning Herald, (2011); Woodfield S., Key Trends and Emerging Issues in International Student Mobility (ISM), Globalization and Internationalization in Higher Education: Theoretical, Strategic and Management Perspectives, pp. 109-123, (2010)","","Gosper M.; Hedberg J.; Carter H.","ASCILITE","Ako Aotearoa; Australian Government; Blackboard; CANVAS; Desire2Learn; echo; EPIGEUM; LAMS International; Macquarie University; mediasite; NET SPOT; PEARSON; PebblePad","30th Annual conference on Australian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education, ASCILITE 2013","1 December 2013 through 4 December 2013","Sydney","110449","","978-174138403-1","","","English","Annu.

We propose a model to mine knowledge from students' opinions to improve teaching effectiveness in academic institutes. Opinion mining is used to evaluate course quality in two steps: opinion classification and opinion extraction. In opinion classification, machine learning methods have been applied to classify an opinion as positive or negative for each student's posts. Then, we used opinion extraction to extract features, such as teacher, exams and resources, from the user-generated content for a specific course. Then we grouped and assigned orientations for each feature. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","E-learning evaluation; mining student opinions; opinion classification; opinion extraction; opinion mining; student evaluation","Curricula; E-learning; Learning systems; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; E-learning evaluation; opinion classification; Opinion extraction; Opinion mining; student evaluation; Quality control","","","","","","","Liu B., Searching Opinions in User-Generated Contents, Invited Talk at the Sixth Annual Emerging Information Technology Conference (EITC 2006), Dallas, Texas, August 10-12 (2006); Leung C.W.K., Chan S.C.F., Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Encyclopedia of Data Warehousing and Mining Information Science Reference, pp. 1794-1799, (2008); Song H., Yao T., Active Learning Based Corpus Annotation, IPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing, Beijing, China, pp. 28-29, (2010); Pang B., Lee L., Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis, Information Retrieval, 2, pp. 121-135, (2008); Huemer M., Student Evaluations: A Critical Review; Kozub R.M., Student Evaluations of Faculty: Concerns and Possible Solutions, Journal of College Teaching & Learning, 5, 11, (2008); Lin H., Pan F., Wang Y., Lv S., Sun S., Affective Computing in E-learning., (2010); Song D., Lin H., Yang Z., Opinion Mining in e-Learning, IFIP International Conference on Network and Parallel Computing Workshops (2007); Thomas E.H., Galambos N., What Satisfies Students?
