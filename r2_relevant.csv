As a result, numerous instruments and strategies for obtaining student input and assessing faculty performance, as well as other facets of education, have been developed. There are two main methods to collect feedback from students, as follows: the direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, feedback is collected by distributing a questionnaire and taking their responses. The limitation of this method is that the true experience of students is not revealed, and there is room for bias in the collection and assessment of such a questionnaire. To overcome this limitation, the indirect method can be followed where social media posts can be used to collect feedback from students as they are active on social media and use it to express their opinions as posts. To address the problem of the manual annotation of large volumes of data, this paper proposes a machine learning method that uses the sentiment 140 dataset as the training set to automate the process of annotations of tweets. The same method can be used to label any qualitative data. In total, 5000 tweets were scraped and considered for this study. Various pre-processing methods, including byte-order-mark removal, hashtag removal, stop word removal, and tokenization, were applied to the data. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) trigrams technique was then used to process the cleaned data. The TF-IDF technique using trigrams captures negation for sentiment analysis. The vectorized data are then processed using various machine learning algorithms to classify the polarity of tweets. Performance parameters such as the F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision are compared. With a 94.16% F1-score, 94% precision, 94% recall, and 95.16% accuracy, the Ridge Classifier performed better than the others. © 2023 by the authors.

Currently, sentiment analysis technology is developing rapidly, but its application in the educational field is lagging. Most of the research is based on sentiment analysis of published texts on social media or videos recorded by students, which may lead to problems such as incomplete feedback content and delayed feedback analysis. Based on the mini-Xception framework, this paper implements the real-time identification and analysis of student sentiment in classroom teaching. Through the feedback results, teachers can fully understand the degree of student engagement and provide reasonable suggestions for subsequent teaching progress. The experimental results show that this method has high recognition accuracy for the real-time detection of seven student sentiments, and the average accuracy is 76.71 %. Compared with after-class student feedback or real-time text sentiment analysis, it can better reflect the real time and high efficiency of information feedback. It provides a basis for teachers to control the teaching rhythm and evaluate the teaching effect and is an effective method for realizing personalized teaching.  © 2021 IEEE.",personalized teaching; real-time; sentiment analysis; student feedback,Feedback; Students; Classroom teaching; Education field; In-depth application; In-depth understanding; Personalized teaching; Real- time; Sentiment analysis; Student feedback; Teachers'; Teaching-learning; Sentiment analysis,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61762023, 62166008)",ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by the Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 61762023 and Grant 62166008.,"Lu W., Jin Y., The analysis on application effect of a provincial modern distance education management information system, International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine & Education, (2016); Zhuo L., Geng Q.X., The application of hybrid flipped classroom in the course of Java programming, International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine & Education, (2016); Ming C., Dan T., The multimedia technology application in the network distance education-accountancy as a model, 2015 7th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, (2015); Andrade A., Delandshere G., Danish J.A., Using multimodal learning analytics to model student behaviour: A systematic analysis of behavioural framing, Journal of Learning Analytics, 3, pp. 282-306, (2016); Liu H., Ma S., Xia D., Li S., Sfanet: A spectrum-aware feature augmentation network for visible-infrared person reidentification, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 14, pp. 1-14, (2021); Umar M., Ahmad N.B., Zainal A., Sentiment analysis of student's opinion on programming assessment: Evaluation of nave bayes over support vector machines, International Journal of Innovative Computing, 10, pp. 51-58, (2020); Zhao Z., Zhu H., Xue Z., Liu Z., Liu M., An image-text consistency driven multimodal sentiment analysis approach for social media, Information Processing & Management, 56, (2019); Nair L.R., Shetty S.D., Shetty S.D., Streaming big data analysis for real-time sentiment based targeted advertising, International Journal of Electrical & Computer Engineering, 7, pp. 402-407, (2017); Kim C.M., Kim K.H., Lee Y.S., Chung K., Park R.C., Real-time streaming image based pp2lfa-crnn model for facial sentiment analysis, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 199586-199602, (2020); Grazulevicius G., Barzdenas V., Vasjanov A., Liobe J., Applying smart devices for gathering real-time feedback from students, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 29, pp. 613-623, (2020); Lin K.C., Huang T.-C., Hung J.C., Yen N.Y., Chen S.J., Facial emotion recognition towards affective computing-based learning, Library Hi Tech, 31, pp. 294-307, (2013); Chollet F., Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, (2017); Arriaga O., Valdenegro-Toro M., Plger P., Real-time convolutional neural networks for emotion and gender classification, The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, (2017); Li H., Zhe L., Shen X., Brandt J., Gang H., A convolutional neural network cascade for face detection, Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition, (2015); Chauhan G.S., Agrawal P., Meena Y.K., Aspect-based sentiment analysis of students' feedback to improve teaching-learning process, Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems, 107, pp. 259-266, (2019); Viola P., Jones M.J., Robust real-time face detection, International Journal of Computer Vision, 57, pp. 137-154, (2004); Jyoti S., Sharma G., Dhall A., Expression empowered residen network for facial action unit detection, 2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, (2019); Zhang S., Zhu X., Lei Z., Shi H., Wang X., Li S.Z., Faceboxes: A cpu real-time face detector with high accuracy, International Joint Conference on Biometrics, (2017); Lominadze A., Real-time expression analysis of students in a classroom using facial emotion recognition, (2020)","D.

Recent advancements in sentiment analysis provide new avenues for evaluating student feedback, particularly through informal channels such as social media. While formal student evaluations offer structured feedback on teaching styles, they may not fully capture the nuanced opinions and sentiments expressed by students in informal settings, such as social media. This research aims to address the gap by integrating sentiment analysis of social media data to evaluate teaching effectiveness across various styles and comparing it with formal evaluation results. This study employs sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to analyze student posts on social media platforms. The analysis includes the extraction of sentiment distributions, identification of common keywords, and tracking of sentiment trends over time. Additionally, formal student evaluations (Likert scale) are collected to offer a direct comparison. The teaching styles analyzed include lecture-based teaching, project-based learning, flipped classrooms, online learning, hybrid learning, and traditional exam-based learning. The findings demonstrate that student sentiment varies significantly across teaching styles. Flipped classrooms and project-based learning received the highest positive sentiment scores, while traditional exam-based teaching showed the most negative sentiment. Social media feedback tended to align with formal evaluations for certain teaching styles, such as the flipped classroom and hybrid learning but showed divergence in others, like online learning, which received higher sentiment in social media feedback. Trends over time reveal evolving sentiments, with fluctuating satisfaction as the academic semester progressed. The integration of social media sentiment analysis provides a more dynamic and real-time understanding of student experiences, offering deeper insights into teaching style effectiveness. © 2025, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

However, to establishing the classification algorithm, an imbalance was evidenced in the amounts of opinions that qualify the teaching performance with the satisfied and dissatisfied class. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to determine the improvement in the performance of the student satisfaction classification algorithm, based on the class balancing method from the application of the minority synthetic oversampling technique (SMOTE). From the methodological point of view, the research is a non-experimental design, applied type, and quantitative approach. The data was collected through the social network Twitter for fifteen weeks to a population defined by mechanical and electrical engineering students. After the application of the SMOTE data balancing technique, it was identified that the algorithm which presents the best performance is Logistic Regression. It was possible to identify that the impact of improvement of the algorithm turned out to be an average of 2.17% in the accuracy, 84.78% in precision, 42% in the Recall (Sensitivity) and 58.33% in the F1-score. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the algorithm classifies with high probability the opinions of the students. © 2023 by the authors.",classification algorithm; oversampling; Performance; student satisfaction; teacher performance,,,,,,,,"Villasmil B.

This article aims to determine student satisfaction with teaching performance, through sentiment analysis. Methodologically, the research is of a non-experimental longitudinal design, with a quantitative approach. Data collection was carried out through the social network Twitter, and data analysis was carried out through the sentiment analysis technique. As a result, it was identified that in the first week of class, the highest level of satisfaction was obtained, reaching 96.3% of the total number of students. Meanwhile, in the evaluation weeks, the highest level of dissatisfaction was reaching 29.17%. It is concluded that when going from totally virtual learning to hybrid learning, students express a certain level of dissatisfaction typical of a process of progressive adaptation. Therefore, teachers should take advantage of these findings to redesign assessment rubrics in the context of hybrid teaching. Aspects such as collecting opinions through social networks and extracting a degree of satisfaction through them apply in a crossed way to other professional fields. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This leads us to wonder why this survey is applied only once and why it only asks about some factors. The objective of the article is to demonstrate the feasibility of a proposal to determine the degree of perception of student satisfaction through the use of data science and natural language processing (NLP), supported by the social network twitter, as an element of data collection. As a result of the application of this proposal based on data science, it was possible to determine the level of student satisfaction, being 57.27%, through sentiment analysis using the Python library ""NLTK""; Thus, it was also possible to extract texts linked to the relevant factors of teaching performance to achieve student satisfaction, through the term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach, these being those linked to the use of tools of simulation in the virtual learning process. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This article aims to identify the best algorithm to classify the satisfaction of university students applying the K-fold cross-validation technique, comparing the error rates of the performance metrics before and after its application. The method used began with the collection of student opinions on the teaching performance of the social network Twitter during an academic semester. Then, sentiment analysis was used for data processing, through which it was possible to categorize the opinions of the students into “satisfied” or “dissatisfied.” The results showed that the algorithm with the lowest error rate in its performance metric was the support vector machine (SVM). In addition, it was identified that its classification probability reached an accuracy of 91.76%. It is concluded that SVM classification using K-fold cross-validation will contribute to determining which factors associated with the teacher’s didactic strategies should be improved in each class session, since traditional surveying techniques have shortcomings. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

Because of this, it is very important to assess how well teachers are performing with this new way of online teaching. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a new field that emerged from using data mining techniques to analyze educational data and making decision based on findings. EDM can be utilized to gain better understanding about students and their learning processes, assist teachers do their academic tasks, and make judgments about how to manage educational system. The primary objective of this study is to uncover the key factors that influence the quality of teaching in a virtual classroom environment. Data is gathered from the students’ evaluation of teaching from computer science students of three online semesters at X University. In total, 27622 students participated in these survey. Weka, sentimental analysis, and word cloud generator are applied in the process of carrying out the research. The decision tree classifies the factors affecting the performance of the teachers, and we find that student-faculty relation is the most prominent factor for improving the teaching quality. The sentimental analysis reveals that around 78% of opinions are positive and “good” is the most frequently used word in the opinions. If the education system is moved online in the future, this research will help figure out what needs to be changed to improve teachers’ overall performance and the quality of their teaching. © 2022, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

Drawing upon social exchange theory and cognitive load theory, this study explored the effect of teacher interaction in the class virtual community on student satisfaction. A multi-wave survey including 525 students was conducted. Results showed that teacher interaction in the virtual community has a positive effect on students’ satisfaction by promoting knowledge sharing, but it also has a negative effect on students’ satisfaction by increasing learning pressure. The positive effect of teacher interaction in the virtual community is strong for students who have a high preference for virtual communities, whereas the negative effect is magnified for students who have a low preference for virtual communities. The findings provide a comprehensive picture of the effect of virtual community in enhancing teaching quality and reveal the underlying mechanisms. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",knowledge sharing; learning pressure; satisfaction; student preference; Virtual learning community,,,,,,,,"Abeele M.V., De Wolf R., Ling R., Mobile media and social space: How anytime, anyplace connectivity structures everyday life, Media and Communication, 6, 2, pp. 5-14, (2018); Adedoyin O.B., Soykan E., Covid-19 pandemic and online learning: The challenges and opportunities, Interactive Learning Environments, 31, 2, pp. 863-875, (2020); Aiken L.A., West S.G., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Al Rawashdeh A.Z., Mohammed E.Y., Al Arab A.R., Alara M., Al-Rawashdeh B., Al-Rawashdeh B., Advantages and disadvantages of using e-learning in university education: Analyzing students’ perspectives, Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 19, 3, pp. 107-117, (2021); Barker J., Gossman P., The learning impact of a virtual learning environment: Students’ views, Teacher Education Advancement Network Journal (TEAN), 5, 2, pp. 19-38, (2013); Besser A., Flett G.L., Zeigler-Hill V., Adaptability to a sudden transition to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: Understanding the challenges for students, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Psychology, 8, 2, pp. 85-105, (2022); Bringman-Rodenbarger L., Hortsch M., How students choose e-learning resources: The importance of ease, familiarity, and convenience, FASEB BioAdvances, 2, 5, pp. 286-295, (2020); Brislin R.W., Translation and content analysis of oral and written material, Handbook of cross-cultural psychology, pp. 389-444, (1980); Cohen S., Kamarck T., Mermelstein R., A global measure of perceived stress, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 24, 4, pp. 385-396, (1983); Cook K.S., Cheshire C., Rice E.R., Nakagawa S., Social exchange theory, Handbook of social psychology, pp. 61-88, (2013); Cropanzano R., Anthony E.L., Daniels S.R., Hall A.V., Social exchange theory: A critical review with theoretical remedies, Academy of Management Annals, 11, 1, pp. 479-516, (2017); Cropanzano R., Mitchell M.S., Social exchange theory: An interdisciplinary review, Journal of Management, 31, 6, pp. 874-900, (2005); Daniel B.K., Schwier R.A., Ross H.M., Synthesis of the process of learning through discourse in a formal virtual learning community, Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 18, 4, pp. 461-477, (2007); Dung D.T.H., The advantages and disadvantages of virtual learning, IOSR Journal of Research & Method in Education, 10, 3, pp. 45-48, (2020); Eid M.I., Al-Jabri I.M., Social networking, knowledge sharing, and student learning: The case of university students, Computers & Education, 99, pp. 14-27, (2016); Elfaki N.K., Abdulraheem I., Abdulrahim R., Impact of e-learning vs traditional learning on student’s performance and attitude, International Medical Journal, 24, 3, pp. 225-233, (2019); Farh J.L., Hackett R.D., Liang J., Individual-level cultural values as moderators of perceived organizational support-employee outcome relationships in China: Comparing the effects of power distance and traditionality, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 3, pp. 715-729, (2007); Ferri F., Grifoni P., Guzzo T., Online learning and emergency remote teaching: Opportunities and challenges in emergency situations, Societies, 10, 4, (2020); Gouldner A.W., The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement, American Sociological Review, 25, 2, pp. 161-178, (1960); Hassan M.M., Mirza T., Hussain M.W., A critical review by teachers on the online teaching-learning during the COVID-19, International Journal of Education and Management Engineering, 10, 8, pp. 17-27, (2020); Henritius E., Lofstrom E., Hannula M.S., University students’ emotions in virtual learning: A review of empirical research in the 21st century, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 1, pp. 80-100, (2019); Himat A.N., Takal M.H., Hakimi M.F., Afghan students’ satisfaction from online learning during COVID-19 at Kandahar University, Kandahar, Afghanistan, American International Journal of Social Science Research, 6, 1, pp. 16-29, (2021); Hsu M.H., Ju T.L., Yen C.H., Chang C.M., Knowledge sharing behavior in virtual communities: The relationship between trust, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 65, 2, pp. 153-169, (2007); Hung S.-W., Cheng M.-J., Are you ready for knowledge sharing?

The widespread adoption of 5G technology has pushed online learning even further into the mainstream. However, because online teaching does not have the drawback of being intuitive like classroom teaching, teachers' assessments of students' learning situations are less accurate. As a result, how to effectively evaluate students' academic performance in the context of 5G wireless network technology is a pressing issue that must be investigated. By processing these heterogeneous large-scale learning records and integrating multiple perspectives to analyze this learning record information to identify students' learning behaviors, this study proposes an integrated analysis algorithm based on artificial intelligence information technology. The possible learning outcomes of students are predicted based on their current learning situation, so teachers can provide auxiliary teaching strategies to students who may have learning difficulties based on the predicted information. The method proposed in this article uses information technology to predict students' grades, and the analysis shows that the method is very effective. In this article, different grades of classification methods are used to analyze and predict the whole students. All grade classification methods are effective in describing decision rules. No matter what grades classification method is used, the error rate of students' grades distribution is predicted to be below 40%.  © 2022 Yushu Guan.",,Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Knowledge; Learning;

The core idea of this paper is to map the connection between teaching practices to student learning in an online environment. Face to face evaluation techniques are fairly quick and easy for formative assessments to check student understanding in existent environment. Prevailing studies illustrate that a person's facial expressions and emotions are closely related. In order to make the teaching-learning process more effective, teachers usually collect day to day feedback from the students. This feedback can be used to improve teaching skills and make the process more interactive. In a virtual learning mode, there is a need to identify and understand the emotions of people. Constructive information can be extracted from online platforms using facial recognition algorithms. An online course connected with students is used for examination; the results have shown that this technique performs strongly.  © 2021 IEEE.",Emotion analysis; facial landmark points; lecture feedback; MTCNN; student involvement; teacher assessment,E-learning; Face recognition; Education systems; Emotion analysis; Facial landmark; Facial landmark point; Lecture feedback; MTCNN; On-line education; Student emotions; Student involvements; Teacher assessments; Students,,,,,,,"Wang W., Xu K., Niu H., Miao X., Emotion recognition of students based on facial expressions in online education based on the perspective of computer simulation, Hindawi Complexity, 2020, pp. 1-9, (2020); Darwin C., Prodger P., The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, (1998); Tian Y.-I., Kanade T., Cohn J.F., Recognizing action units for facial expression analysis, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 23, 2, pp. 97-115, (2001); Goodfellow J., Erhan D., Carrier P.L., Et al., Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests, Neural Information Processing, pp. 117-124, (2013); Zeng Z., Pantic M., Roisman G.I., Huang T.S., A survey of affect recognition methods: Audio, visual, and spontaneous expressions, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31, 1, pp. 39-58, (2009); Sariyanidi E., Gunes H., Cavallaro A., Automatic analysis of facial affect: A survey of registration, representation, and Complexity 7 recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37, 6, pp. 1113-1133, (2015); Martinez B., Valstar M.F., Advances, challenges, and opportunities in automatic facial expression recognition, Advances in Face Detection and Facial Image Analysis, pp. 63-100, (2016); Devi Burri R., Manvitha Enadula S., Devi Odugu R., Prasad V.B.V.N., Decision making for common stock selection using Regression Techniques, Test Engineering and Management, 83, (2020); Gunes H., Schuller B., Categorical and dimensional affect analysis in continuous input: Current trends and future directions, Image and Vision Computing, 31, 2, pp. 120-136, (2013); Li S., Deng W., Deep facial expression recognition: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing; Wang M., Deng W., Deep Face Recognition: A Survey; Devi Burri R., Burri R., Reddy Bojja R., Buraga S., Insurance claim analysis using machine learning algorithms, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 8, 6 S4, (2019); Lin J., Zhou T., Chen Z., DeepIR: A Deep Semantics Driven Framework for Image Retargeting; Zhang K., Zhang Z., Li Z., Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks; Devi Burri R., Madhuri A., Sai Raghavendra D.N., A multi resolution convolution neural network based face recognition analysis, Journal of Critical Reviews, 7, 18, (2020); Triantafyllidou D., Tefas A., A fast deep convolutional neural network for face detection in big visual data, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, (2017); Zeng Z., Pantic M., Roisman G.I., Huang T.S., A survey of affect recognition methods: Audio, visual, and spontaneous expressions, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis AndMachine Intelligence, 31, 1, pp. 39-58, (2009); Sariyanidi E., Gunes H., Cavallaro A., Automatic analysis of facial affect: A survey of registration, representation, and Complexity 7 recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37, 6, pp. 1113-1133, (2015); Zhang N., Gao W., Luo J., Research on face detection technology based on MTCNN, 2020 International Conference on Computer Network, Electronic and Automation (ICCNEA)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"4th International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies, ICECCT 2021",15 September 2021 through 17 September 2021,Erode,175062.0,,978-166541480-7,,,English,"Int.

Firstly, analyse social network theory, design a social network analysis process, and then select an online course of 'Advanced Mathematics' from a certain university for research. Use crawler algorithms to obtain interactive data between teachers, students, and students on the platform to achieve community graph visualisation. Finally, by analysing the density, distribution, and centrality of community networks, the correlation between centrality and the current situation and quality of curriculum teaching is explored. Based on this result, a quality evaluation model is explored, which can be optimised by introducing social network analysis methods and establishing a scientific student and teacher evaluation mechanism. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",online courses in universities; SNA; social network analysis; teaching quality evaluation; teaching status,Curricula; E-learning; Quality control; Social networking (online); Students; Current quality; Current situation evaluations; Online course; Online course in university; Quality evaluation; SNA; Social Network Analysis; Teaching quality; Teaching quality evaluation; Teaching status; Teaching,,,,,,,"Da X., Research on the current situation and countermeasures of online teaching operation and management in universities - review of 'selected reports on online teaching quality in universities, Theory and Practice of Education, 42, 35, (2022); Huang W., Yao Z., Current situation and spatial structure of scientific research cooperation and innovation among universities in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater bay area: analysis of social networks based on the national knowledge infrastructure database, Science and Technology Management Research, 42, 7, pp. 87-93, (2022); Huang Y., Xin Z., Li W., Research on the Weibo information communication network of the communist youth league in universities in the new media era: from the perspective of social network analysis, Journal of China Youth University for Political Sciences, 40, 4, pp. 36-44, (2021); Wang B., Li Y., A study on the interaction behavior of MOOC discussion areas in college English based on social network analysis, Foreign Languages Research, 39, 4, pp. 59-64, (2022); Wang C., Discussion on online teaching design of bodybuilding course in college under the background of the COVID-19, Journal of Physical Education, 28, 2, pp. 97-102, (2021); Wang J., Research on online course evaluation in colleges and universities based on the 'Internet plus' background - review of 'monitoring and evaluation of teaching quality in colleges and universities, Science and Technology Management Research, 41, 16, (2021); Wei M., Shan Y., Zheng C., Development and application of 'education for innovation' classroom teaching quality evaluation tool in colleges and universities, Journal of Northeast Normal University (Philosophy and Social Sciences), 27, 3, pp. 131-138, (2022); Wu Y., Chen L., Research on online teaching models and innovative characteristics of primary and secondary schools in China during the epidemic: mining and analysis based on the perspective of teaching interaction, Distance Education in China, 2021, 2, pp. 17-26, (2021); Zhou L., Qiu Q., Chen Q., Research on the characteristics of spatial association network of sports industry in Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Greater Bay Area - based on Gravity model and social network analysis, Social Sciences In Guangdong, 2021, 2, pp. 100-108, (2021); Zhu B., Research on Improving the quality of mathematics teaching in higher education institutions in the new era - review of 'innovation in mathematics teaching and models in higher education institutions, Science and Technology Management Research, 41, 22, (2021)","W.

This algorithm factored in school attainment in each subject over the previous three years. Government officials initially stated that the algorithm was used to combat grade inflation. After public outcry, teacher assessment grades used instead. Views concerning who was to blame for this scandal were expressed on the social media website Twitter. While previous work used NLP-based opinion mining computational linguistic tools to analyse this discourse, shortcomings included accuracy issues, difficulties in interpretation and limited conclusions on who authors blamed. Thus, we chose to complement this research by analysing 18,239 tweets relating to the A Level algorithm using Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), underpinned by social actor representation. We examined how blame was attributed to different entities who were presented as social actors or having social agency. Through analysing transitivity in this discourse, we found the algorithm itself, the UK government and Ofqual were all implicated as potentially responsible as social actors through active agency, agency metaphor possession and instances of passive constructions. According to our results, students were found to have limited blame through the same analysis. We discuss how this builds upon existing research where the algorithm is implicated and how such a wide range of constructions obscure blame. Methodologically, we demonstrated that CL and CDA complement existing NLP-based computational linguistic tools in researching the 2020 A Level algorithm; however, there is further scope for how these approaches can be used in an iterative manner.

RG automatically provides a metric, the RG Score, to each RG account holder that serves as a measure of that SRA's ""academic""worth, productivity, and interaction with other SRAs. In 2017, this metric was described by RG as ""the RG Score takes all your research and turns it into a source of reputation,""indicating that ""it is calculated based on the research in your profile and how other researchers interact with your content.""However, the precise manner in which the RG Score is calculated was never made public because it is a proprietary algorithm, and requests to RG to disclose details of the equations used to calculate it were not met. Not unsurprisingly, RG announced that it would be phasing out the RG Score in June 2022. This article examines what is known in the literature about the RG Score, which may be perceived as a skewed metric because it may add excessive weighting to select aspects, such as questions and answers, rather than to the published literature of an SRA. The RG Interest Score is also critiqued. An author-based metric such as the RG Score that reflects a realistic balance between the most important academic factors while downplaying fairly redundant aspects such as the volume of answers might benefit SRAs. As for any metric, the RG Score should not be used in isolation, be gamed, or used as the basis of any financial remuneration schemes. © University of Toronto Press, 2023.",academic social network; accountability; altmetrics; metrics; proprietary algorithm; social web metrics; transparency,,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (20H04581, 21H03784)","Although this study and project was not funded, YY was funded by JSPS KAKENHI (20H04581 and 21H03784).

Therefore, a social network-based evaluation method for educational and teaching effectiveness in universities is proposed. First, we analyse the role of teaching effectiveness evaluation and design the principles for constructing a teaching effectiveness evaluation index system. Then, we calculate the entropy matching degree of evaluation indicators, set consistency criteria for evaluation indicators, and use SVM algorithm to classify evaluation indicators, constructing an evaluation indicator system. Finally, we construct a social network for teaching effectiveness evaluation, determine the subgroup cohesion of evaluation indicators, construct an education and teaching effectiveness evaluation function, and obtain the evaluation results. The experimental results show that the confidence level of the evaluation results of this method is high, and the matching error of the entropy value of the evaluation indicators is low.  © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",entropy matching degree; indicator system; social network; the effectiveness of higher education and teaching,Economic and social effects; Entropy; Effectiveness evaluation; Entropy matching; Entropy matching degree; Evaluation indicators; High educations; Indicators systems; Matching degree; Social network; Teaching effectiveness; The effectiveness of high education and teaching; Quality control,,,,,,,"Cilliers J., Fleisch B., Kotze J., Mohohlwane M., Taylor S., The challenge of sustaining effective teaching: spillovers, fade-out, and the cost-effectiveness of teacher development programs, Economics of Education Review, 87, 2, pp. 1-10, (2022); Ding X., Salam Z.A., Lv W., Research on timeliness evaluation model of online teaching based on intelligent learning, International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Life-Long Learning, 31, 2, pp. 263-275, (2021); Du P., An English teaching ability evaluation model based on edge computing, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 36, 3, pp. 1-8, (2022); Fan P., Application of deep learning and cloud data platform in college teaching quality evaluation, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology, 41, 5, pp. 5770-5779, (2020); Gao B., Research and implementation of intelligent evaluation system of teaching quality in universities based on artificial intelligence neural network model, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 12, 5, pp. 1-10, (2022); Huang J., An internet of things evaluation algorithm for quality assessment of computer-based teaching, Mobile Information Systems, 13, 2, pp. 1-10, (2021); Ibrahim H., The satisfaction of students about how instructional design quality criteria for e-course in distance learning, International Journal of Educational Technology and Learning, 8, 2, pp. 70-82, (2020); Ji S., Tsai S.B., A study on the quality evaluation of English teaching based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of bat algorithm and big data analysis, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 65, 43, pp. 1-12, (2021); Li G., Liu F., Wang Y., Guo Y., Xiao L., Zhu L., A convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for the recognition and evaluation of classroom teaching behavior, Scientific Programming, 41, 9, pp. 1-8, (2021); Liu G., Zhuang H., Evaluation model of multimedia-aided teaching effect of physical education course based on random forest algorithm, Journal of Intelligent Systems, 31, 1, pp. 555-567, (2022); Luo R., Liao Q., Zheng J., Zhao L., A study on the evaluation method of foreign language classroom teaching process from the perspective of neuroeducation, International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 20, 7, pp. 2092-2104, (2021); Su Y., Chen G., Li M., Shi T., Fang D., Design and implementation of web multimedia teaching evaluation system based on artificial intelligence and jQuery, Mobile Information Systems, 23, 12, pp. 1-12, (2021); Wang H., Du Y., Tsai S.B., Evaluation of the effectiveness computer-assisted language teaching by big data analysis, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 15, 9, pp. 1-11, (2021); Wu G., Zheng J., Zhai J., Individualized learning evaluation model based on hybrid teaching, International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 7, 2, pp. 8393-8399, (2021); Yang Y., Quality evaluation method of a mathematics teaching model reform based on an improved genetic algorithm, Scientific Programming, 33, 6, pp. 639-649, (2021); Yu H., Online teaching quality evaluation based on emotion recognition and improved AprioriTid algorithm, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology, 14, 4, pp. 40-45, (2021); Yuan F., Nie Y., Online classroom teaching quality evaluation system based on facial feature recognition, Scientific Programming, 39, 14, pp. 1-10, (2021); Zhang J., Addae H.M., Bakeman M., Management students' perceptions of online teaching quality, e-Journal of Business Education and Scholarship of Teaching, 14, 2, pp. 33-52, (2020)","Q.

We offer results from an intercollegiate collaboration that provides an innovative learning environment through a social media education ecosystem. Participating students discuss current marketing topics with peers, marketing practitioners, and faculty to reinforce course concepts, improve learning perceptions, and increase professional communication skills and networking opportunities. An initial exploratory study provides a snapshot of Twitter analytics, illustrating the reach of students’ marketing-related discussions. Next, survey data collected from students show increased learning satisfaction and favorable behavioral intentions. Finally, tweets from the 12-week project were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Results suggest that participants improved their professional communication skills while using language that provokes greater cognitive processes. Implications for marketing educators and future directions for the project are also provided. © The Author(s) 2018.",experiential learning techniques; innovative teaching methods; measuring teaching effectiveness; skills/traits development in marketing education; surveys; written communication,,,,,,,,"Ackerman D.S., Gross B.L., Perner L., Instructor, student, and employer perception on preparing marketing students for changing business landscapes, Journal of Marketing Education, 25, pp. 46-56, (2003); Anderson L.W., Krathwohl D.R., A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives, (2001); Aviv R., Ravid G., Reciprocity analysis of online learning networks, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 9, 4, pp. 3-13, (2005); Bal A.S., Grewal D., Mills A., Ottley G., Engaging students with social media, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, pp. 190-203, (2015); Beaudreau S.A., Storandt M., Strube M.J., A comparison of narratives told by younger and older adults, Experimental Aging Research, 32, pp. 105-117, (2006); Blessing S.B., Blessing J.S., Fleck B.K., Using Twitter to reinforce classroom concepts, Teaching of Psychology, 39, pp. 268-271, (2012); Boyatzis R.E., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); Brush C.G., Exploring the concept of an entrepreneurship education ecosystem, Innovative pathways for university entrepreneurship in the 21st century, pp. 25-39, (2014); Casey S., Nielsen Social Media Report, (2017); Chen J., Hsieh G., Mahmud J., Nichols J., Understanding individuals’ personal values from social media word use, pp. 405-414, (2014); Clarke T.B., Nelson C.L., Classroom community, pedagogical effectiveness, and learning outcomes associated with Twitter use in undergraduate marketing courses, Journal for Advancement of Marketing Education, 20, pp. 29-38, (2012); Cohn M.A., Mehl M.R., Pennebaker J.W., Linguistic markers of psychological change surrounding, Psychological Science, 15, 10, pp. 687-693, (2004); Crittenden V., Crittenden W., Digital and Social Media Marketing in Business Education: Implications for the Marketing Curriculum, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, 3, pp. 131-132, (2015); Dowell D.J., Small F.A., What is the impact of online resource materials on student self-learning strategies?, Journal of Marketing Education, 33, pp. 140-148, (2011); Duffy K., Ney J., Exploring the divides among students, educators, and practitioners in the use of digital media as a pedagogical tool, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, pp. 104-113, (2015); Dunham K., The beginner’s guide to social media metrics: Engagement, (2014); Dunlap J.C., Lowenthal P.R., Tweeting the night away: Using Twitter to enhance social presence, Journal of Information Systems Education, 20, pp. 129-135, (2009); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research, (1975); Gao F., Luo T., Zhang K., Tweeting for learning: A critical analysis of research on microblogging in education published in 2008–2011, British Journal of Educational Technology, 43, pp. 783-801, (2012); Hancock J.T., Beaver D.I., Chung C.K., Frazee J., Pennebaker J.W., Graesser A., Cai Z., Social language processing: A framework for analyzing the communication of terrorists and authoritarian regimes, Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism & Political Aggression, 2, pp. 108-132, (2010); Handelsman M.M., Briggs W.L., Sullivan N., Towler A., A measure of college student course engagement, Journal of Educational Research, 98, pp. 184-192, (2005); Heiberger G., Harper R., Have you Facebooked Astin lately?

This study included 22 high-quality peer-reviewed journal articles for the meta-analysis. The authors reveal that there are no significant differences in teaching effectiveness between the Twitter and non-Twitter-assisted learning approaches. Twitter-assisted learning outcomes are significantly higher than the non-Twitter-assisted whether Twitter is used as a supplementary or an integrated tool. Twitter-assisted learning can lead to significantly higher learning outcomes than non-Twitter-assisted learning in the USA, Greece, and Sweden, but no significant difference is revealed in Spain. Swedish users hold significantly positive attitudes towards the use of Twitter in education, but no significant difference is found in the USA. Twitter-assisted learning can cause significantly more engagement than non-Twitter-assisted in the USA, and male learners have significantly higher learning outcomes than females in both the USA and Spain. © 2022 Authors.

The application of the “hybrid” teaching model in online and offline college English teaching is the trend and the focus of local higher education reform. Nowadays, many universities at home and abroad have successively established online platforms and launched online courses, striving for seamless connection between online and offline classrooms. It can be seen that exploring the “blended” teaching mode of online and offline in local higher education institutions is a trend of the times and the current situation of English language classrooms in universities. The online and offline blended teaching effectiveness evaluation of college English courses is regarded as multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM). In this paper, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic numbers grey relational analysis (TFNN-GRA) method is designed for MADM based on the classical point GRA and triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs). Finally, a numerical example for online and offline blended teaching effectiveness evaluation of college English courses is given and some comparisons are done to show the advantages of TFNN-GRA method. © 2023 – IOS Press.
