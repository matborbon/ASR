Employing social capital theory, we investigate the mechanisms through which social media usage affects organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) of faculty in Kenyan private universities. OCB is an important aspect of universities’ performance, given the high level of autonomy in universities. We develop a theoretical model that posits direct links to OCB of three social media usages (social, cognitive, and hedonic) which affect OCB. We also posit indirect links (using autonomy as a mediator) that affect faculty’s intrinsic motivation for OCB. Using descriptive cross-sectional survey, a mediated model was tested on 388 faculty. Results revealed: 1) social media usage significantly impacts OCB, with social and cognitive having a positive relationship, and hedonic having a negative relationship with OCB; 2) social media usage tends to increase autonomy. Findings of this study contribute towards job performance improvement. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",autonomy; faculty performance; organisational citizenship behaviour; Social media use,Behavioral research; Social networking (online); Autonomy; Employee behavior; Faculty members; Faculty performance; Media usage; Media use; Organizational citizenship behaviors; Performance; Social media; Social medium use; Economic and social effects,,,,,,,"Abbasi S.G., Abbasi U.A., Dastgeer G., Khiza U., Arshad R., Exposure to social media and organizational citizenship behavior: Role of perceived risk and stress, PalArch’s Journal of Archaeology of Egypt/egyptology, 17, 8, pp. 247-262, (2020); Akbari E., Pilot A., Simons P.R.-J., Autonomy, competence, and relatedness in foreign language learning through Facebook, Computers in Human Behavior, 48, pp. 126-134, (2015); Akbari E., Simons R.-J., Efficacy of using social networks in learning and teaching based on self-determination theory: An interventional study, Interdisciplinary Journal of Virtual Learning in Medical Sciences, 9, 4, (2018); Akturan A., Cekmecelioglu H.G., The effects of knowledge sharing and organizational citizenship behaviors on creative behaviors in educational institutions, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 235, pp. 342-350, (2016); Al-Abrrow H., Thajil K.M., Abdullah H.O., Abbas S., The dark triad and organizational citizenship behavior in health care: The moderating role of positive emotions, Global Business and Organizational Excellence, 39, 5, pp. 6-17, (2020); Ali-Hassan H., Nevo D., Wade M., Linking dimensions of social media use to job performance: The role of social capital, Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 24, 2, pp. 65-89, (2015); Ali M.Y., Khawaja W.S., Bhatti R., YouTube usage of faculty of an Engineering University of Karachi, Pakistan: Implications of media literacy through librarian, International Information & Library Review, 51, 4, pp. 328-337, (2019); Al-Qaysi N., Mohamad Nordin N., Al-Emran M., Employing the technology acceptance model in social media: A systematic review, Education and Information Technologies, 25, 6, pp. 4961-5002, (2020); Anastasiadis C., Tsounis A., Sarafis P., The relationship between stress, social capital and quality of education among medical residents, BMC Research Notes, 11, 1, (2018); Andriopoulos A., Olsson E.M., Sylven Y.H., Sjostrom J., Johansson B., von Essen L., Gronqvist H., Commencement of and retention in web-based interventions and response to prompts and reminders: Longitudinal observational study based on two randomized controlled trials, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 23, 3, (2021); Atieno A.V., Onyancha O.B., Kwanya T., Trends, patterns and determinants of research productivity at the Technical University of Kenya, Information Development, 38, 1, pp. 97-113, (2022); Bateman T.S., Organ D.W., Job satisfaction and the good soldier: The relationship between affect and employee “citizenship, Academy of Management Journal, 26, 4, pp. 587-595, (1983); Beare E.C., O'raghallaigh P., McAvoy J., Hayes J., Employees’ emotional reactions to digitally enabled work events, Journal of Decision Systems, 29, sup1, pp. 226-242, (2020); Bentzen T.O., The birdcage is open, but will the bird fly?

Social media-based evaluations, such as RateMyProfessors.com, empower students to evaluate faculty anonymously. A perusal of the literature indicates little to no prior research conducted on faculty perceptions of student usage of online evaluations. We posit that business students embody unique characteristics that influence their usage. We examine whether business students use RateMyProfessors.com in an ethical manner (i.e., honestly and without grade-related bias) and moderately (i.e., not only to rant or rave), whether gender differences exist in evaluations, and how confident students are in their evaluative abilities.

This leads us to wonder why this survey is applied only once and why it only asks about some factors. The objective of the article is to demonstrate the feasibility of a proposal to determine the degree of perception of student satisfaction through the use of data science and natural language processing (NLP), supported by the social network twitter, as an element of data collection. As a result of the application of this proposal based on data science, it was possible to determine the level of student satisfaction, being 57.27%, through sentiment analysis using the Python library ""NLTK""; Thus, it was also possible to extract texts linked to the relevant factors of teaching performance to achieve student satisfaction, through the term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach, these being those linked to the use of tools of simulation in the virtual learning process. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This article aims to determine student satisfaction with teaching performance, through sentiment analysis. Methodologically, the research is of a non-experimental longitudinal design, with a quantitative approach. Data collection was carried out through the social network Twitter, and data analysis was carried out through the sentiment analysis technique. As a result, it was identified that in the first week of class, the highest level of satisfaction was obtained, reaching 96.3% of the total number of students. Meanwhile, in the evaluation weeks, the highest level of dissatisfaction was reaching 29.17%. It is concluded that when going from totally virtual learning to hybrid learning, students express a certain level of dissatisfaction typical of a process of progressive adaptation. Therefore, teachers should take advantage of these findings to redesign assessment rubrics in the context of hybrid teaching. Aspects such as collecting opinions through social networks and extracting a degree of satisfaction through them apply in a crossed way to other professional fields. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Recent advancements in sentiment analysis provide new avenues for evaluating student feedback, particularly through informal channels such as social media. While formal student evaluations offer structured feedback on teaching styles, they may not fully capture the nuanced opinions and sentiments expressed by students in informal settings, such as social media. This research aims to address the gap by integrating sentiment analysis of social media data to evaluate teaching effectiveness across various styles and comparing it with formal evaluation results. This study employs sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to analyze student posts on social media platforms. The analysis includes the extraction of sentiment distributions, identification of common keywords, and tracking of sentiment trends over time. Additionally, formal student evaluations (Likert scale) are collected to offer a direct comparison. The teaching styles analyzed include lecture-based teaching, project-based learning, flipped classrooms, online learning, hybrid learning, and traditional exam-based learning. The findings demonstrate that student sentiment varies significantly across teaching styles. Flipped classrooms and project-based learning received the highest positive sentiment scores, while traditional exam-based teaching showed the most negative sentiment. Social media feedback tended to align with formal evaluations for certain teaching styles, such as the flipped classroom and hybrid learning but showed divergence in others, like online learning, which received higher sentiment in social media feedback. Trends over time reveal evolving sentiments, with fluctuating satisfaction as the academic semester progressed. The integration of social media sentiment analysis provides a more dynamic and real-time understanding of student experiences, offering deeper insights into teaching style effectiveness. © 2025, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

Because of this, it is very important to assess how well teachers are performing with this new way of online teaching. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a new field that emerged from using data mining techniques to analyze educational data and making decision based on findings. EDM can be utilized to gain better understanding about students and their learning processes, assist teachers do their academic tasks, and make judgments about how to manage educational system. The primary objective of this study is to uncover the key factors that influence the quality of teaching in a virtual classroom environment. Data is gathered from the students’ evaluation of teaching from computer science students of three online semesters at X University. In total, 27622 students participated in these survey. Weka, sentimental analysis, and word cloud generator are applied in the process of carrying out the research. The decision tree classifies the factors affecting the performance of the teachers, and we find that student-faculty relation is the most prominent factor for improving the teaching quality. The sentimental analysis reveals that around 78% of opinions are positive and “good” is the most frequently used word in the opinions. If the education system is moved online in the future, this research will help figure out what needs to be changed to improve teachers’ overall performance and the quality of their teaching. © 2022, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

Currently, sentiment analysis technology is developing rapidly, but its application in the educational field is lagging. Most of the research is based on sentiment analysis of published texts on social media or videos recorded by students, which may lead to problems such as incomplete feedback content and delayed feedback analysis. Based on the mini-Xception framework, this paper implements the real-time identification and analysis of student sentiment in classroom teaching. Through the feedback results, teachers can fully understand the degree of student engagement and provide reasonable suggestions for subsequent teaching progress. The experimental results show that this method has high recognition accuracy for the real-time detection of seven student sentiments, and the average accuracy is 76.71 %. Compared with after-class student feedback or real-time text sentiment analysis, it can better reflect the real time and high efficiency of information feedback. It provides a basis for teachers to control the teaching rhythm and evaluate the teaching effect and is an effective method for realizing personalized teaching.  © 2021 IEEE.",personalized teaching; real-time; sentiment analysis; student feedback,Feedback; Students; Classroom teaching; Education field; In-depth application; In-depth understanding; Personalized teaching; Real- time; Sentiment analysis; Student feedback; Teachers'; Teaching-learning; Sentiment analysis,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61762023, 62166008)",ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by the Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 61762023 and Grant 62166008.,"Lu W., Jin Y., The analysis on application effect of a provincial modern distance education management information system, International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine & Education, (2016); Zhuo L., Geng Q.X., The application of hybrid flipped classroom in the course of Java programming, International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine & Education, (2016); Ming C., Dan T., The multimedia technology application in the network distance education-accountancy as a model, 2015 7th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education, (2015); Andrade A., Delandshere G., Danish J.A., Using multimodal learning analytics to model student behaviour: A systematic analysis of behavioural framing, Journal of Learning Analytics, 3, pp. 282-306, (2016); Liu H., Ma S., Xia D., Li S., Sfanet: A spectrum-aware feature augmentation network for visible-infrared person reidentification, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 14, pp. 1-14, (2021); Umar M., Ahmad N.B., Zainal A., Sentiment analysis of student's opinion on programming assessment: Evaluation of nave bayes over support vector machines, International Journal of Innovative Computing, 10, pp. 51-58, (2020); Zhao Z., Zhu H., Xue Z., Liu Z., Liu M., An image-text consistency driven multimodal sentiment analysis approach for social media, Information Processing & Management, 56, (2019); Nair L.R., Shetty S.D., Shetty S.D., Streaming big data analysis for real-time sentiment based targeted advertising, International Journal of Electrical & Computer Engineering, 7, pp. 402-407, (2017); Kim C.M., Kim K.H., Lee Y.S., Chung K., Park R.C., Real-time streaming image based pp2lfa-crnn model for facial sentiment analysis, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 199586-199602, (2020); Grazulevicius G., Barzdenas V., Vasjanov A., Liobe J., Applying smart devices for gathering real-time feedback from students, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 29, pp. 613-623, (2020); Lin K.C., Huang T.-C., Hung J.C., Yen N.Y., Chen S.J., Facial emotion recognition towards affective computing-based learning, Library Hi Tech, 31, pp. 294-307, (2013); Chollet F., Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions, 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, (2017); Arriaga O., Valdenegro-Toro M., Plger P., Real-time convolutional neural networks for emotion and gender classification, The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, (2017); Li H., Zhe L., Shen X., Brandt J., Gang H., A convolutional neural network cascade for face detection, Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition, (2015); Chauhan G.S., Agrawal P., Meena Y.K., Aspect-based sentiment analysis of students' feedback to improve teaching-learning process, Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems, 107, pp. 259-266, (2019); Viola P., Jones M.J., Robust real-time face detection, International Journal of Computer Vision, 57, pp. 137-154, (2004); Jyoti S., Sharma G., Dhall A., Expression empowered residen network for facial action unit detection, 2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, (2019); Zhang S., Zhu X., Lei Z., Shi H., Wang X., Li S.Z., Faceboxes: A cpu real-time face detector with high accuracy, International Joint Conference on Biometrics, (2017); Lominadze A., Real-time expression analysis of students in a classroom using facial emotion recognition, (2020)","D.

However, to establishing the classification algorithm, an imbalance was evidenced in the amounts of opinions that qualify the teaching performance with the satisfied and dissatisfied class. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to determine the improvement in the performance of the student satisfaction classification algorithm, based on the class balancing method from the application of the minority synthetic oversampling technique (SMOTE). From the methodological point of view, the research is a non-experimental design, applied type, and quantitative approach. The data was collected through the social network Twitter for fifteen weeks to a population defined by mechanical and electrical engineering students. After the application of the SMOTE data balancing technique, it was identified that the algorithm which presents the best performance is Logistic Regression. It was possible to identify that the impact of improvement of the algorithm turned out to be an average of 2.17% in the accuracy, 84.78% in precision, 42% in the Recall (Sensitivity) and 58.33% in the F1-score. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the algorithm classifies with high probability the opinions of the students. © 2023 by the authors.",classification algorithm; oversampling; Performance; student satisfaction; teacher performance,,,,,,,,"Villasmil B.

As a result, numerous instruments and strategies for obtaining student input and assessing faculty performance, as well as other facets of education, have been developed. There are two main methods to collect feedback from students, as follows: the direct and indirect methods. In the direct method, feedback is collected by distributing a questionnaire and taking their responses. The limitation of this method is that the true experience of students is not revealed, and there is room for bias in the collection and assessment of such a questionnaire. To overcome this limitation, the indirect method can be followed where social media posts can be used to collect feedback from students as they are active on social media and use it to express their opinions as posts. To address the problem of the manual annotation of large volumes of data, this paper proposes a machine learning method that uses the sentiment 140 dataset as the training set to automate the process of annotations of tweets. The same method can be used to label any qualitative data. In total, 5000 tweets were scraped and considered for this study. Various pre-processing methods, including byte-order-mark removal, hashtag removal, stop word removal, and tokenization, were applied to the data. The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) trigrams technique was then used to process the cleaned data. The TF-IDF technique using trigrams captures negation for sentiment analysis. The vectorized data are then processed using various machine learning algorithms to classify the polarity of tweets. Performance parameters such as the F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision are compared. With a 94.16% F1-score, 94% precision, 94% recall, and 95.16% accuracy, the Ridge Classifier performed better than the others. © 2023 by the authors.

This article aims to identify the best algorithm to classify the satisfaction of university students applying the K-fold cross-validation technique, comparing the error rates of the performance metrics before and after its application. The method used began with the collection of student opinions on the teaching performance of the social network Twitter during an academic semester. Then, sentiment analysis was used for data processing, through which it was possible to categorize the opinions of the students into “satisfied” or “dissatisfied.” The results showed that the algorithm with the lowest error rate in its performance metric was the support vector machine (SVM). In addition, it was identified that its classification probability reached an accuracy of 91.76%. It is concluded that SVM classification using K-fold cross-validation will contribute to determining which factors associated with the teacher’s didactic strategies should be improved in each class session, since traditional surveying techniques have shortcomings. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

Drawing upon social exchange theory and cognitive load theory, this study explored the effect of teacher interaction in the class virtual community on student satisfaction. A multi-wave survey including 525 students was conducted. Results showed that teacher interaction in the virtual community has a positive effect on students’ satisfaction by promoting knowledge sharing, but it also has a negative effect on students’ satisfaction by increasing learning pressure. The positive effect of teacher interaction in the virtual community is strong for students who have a high preference for virtual communities, whereas the negative effect is magnified for students who have a low preference for virtual communities. The findings provide a comprehensive picture of the effect of virtual community in enhancing teaching quality and reveal the underlying mechanisms. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",knowledge sharing; learning pressure; satisfaction; student preference; Virtual learning community,,,,,,,,"Abeele M.V., De Wolf R., Ling R., Mobile media and social space: How anytime, anyplace connectivity structures everyday life, Media and Communication, 6, 2, pp. 5-14, (2018); Adedoyin O.B., Soykan E., Covid-19 pandemic and online learning: The challenges and opportunities, Interactive Learning Environments, 31, 2, pp. 863-875, (2020); Aiken L.A., West S.G., Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, (1991); Al Rawashdeh A.Z., Mohammed E.Y., Al Arab A.R., Alara M., Al-Rawashdeh B., Al-Rawashdeh B., Advantages and disadvantages of using e-learning in university education: Analyzing students’ perspectives, Electronic Journal of e-Learning, 19, 3, pp. 107-117, (2021); Barker J., Gossman P., The learning impact of a virtual learning environment: Students’ views, Teacher Education Advancement Network Journal (TEAN), 5, 2, pp. 19-38, (2013); Besser A., Flett G.L., Zeigler-Hill V., Adaptability to a sudden transition to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: Understanding the challenges for students, Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Psychology, 8, 2, pp. 85-105, (2022); Bringman-Rodenbarger L., Hortsch M., How students choose e-learning resources: The importance of ease, familiarity, and convenience, FASEB BioAdvances, 2, 5, pp. 286-295, (2020); Brislin R.W., Translation and content analysis of oral and written material, Handbook of cross-cultural psychology, pp. 389-444, (1980); Cohen S., Kamarck T., Mermelstein R., A global measure of perceived stress, Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 24, 4, pp. 385-396, (1983); Cook K.S., Cheshire C., Rice E.R., Nakagawa S., Social exchange theory, Handbook of social psychology, pp. 61-88, (2013); Cropanzano R., Anthony E.L., Daniels S.R., Hall A.V., Social exchange theory: A critical review with theoretical remedies, Academy of Management Annals, 11, 1, pp. 479-516, (2017); Cropanzano R., Mitchell M.S., Social exchange theory: An interdisciplinary review, Journal of Management, 31, 6, pp. 874-900, (2005); Daniel B.K., Schwier R.A., Ross H.M., Synthesis of the process of learning through discourse in a formal virtual learning community, Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 18, 4, pp. 461-477, (2007); Dung D.T.H., The advantages and disadvantages of virtual learning, IOSR Journal of Research & Method in Education, 10, 3, pp. 45-48, (2020); Eid M.I., Al-Jabri I.M., Social networking, knowledge sharing, and student learning: The case of university students, Computers & Education, 99, pp. 14-27, (2016); Elfaki N.K., Abdulraheem I., Abdulrahim R., Impact of e-learning vs traditional learning on student’s performance and attitude, International Medical Journal, 24, 3, pp. 225-233, (2019); Farh J.L., Hackett R.D., Liang J., Individual-level cultural values as moderators of perceived organizational support-employee outcome relationships in China: Comparing the effects of power distance and traditionality, Academy of Management Journal, 50, 3, pp. 715-729, (2007); Ferri F., Grifoni P., Guzzo T., Online learning and emergency remote teaching: Opportunities and challenges in emergency situations, Societies, 10, 4, (2020); Gouldner A.W., The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement, American Sociological Review, 25, 2, pp. 161-178, (1960); Hassan M.M., Mirza T., Hussain M.W., A critical review by teachers on the online teaching-learning during the COVID-19, International Journal of Education and Management Engineering, 10, 8, pp. 17-27, (2020); Henritius E., Lofstrom E., Hannula M.S., University students’ emotions in virtual learning: A review of empirical research in the 21st century, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 1, pp. 80-100, (2019); Himat A.N., Takal M.H., Hakimi M.F., Afghan students’ satisfaction from online learning during COVID-19 at Kandahar University, Kandahar, Afghanistan, American International Journal of Social Science Research, 6, 1, pp. 16-29, (2021); Hsu M.H., Ju T.L., Yen C.H., Chang C.M., Knowledge sharing behavior in virtual communities: The relationship between trust, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 65, 2, pp. 153-169, (2007); Hung S.-W., Cheng M.-J., Are you ready for knowledge sharing?

The widespread adoption of 5G technology has pushed online learning even further into the mainstream. However, because online teaching does not have the drawback of being intuitive like classroom teaching, teachers' assessments of students' learning situations are less accurate. As a result, how to effectively evaluate students' academic performance in the context of 5G wireless network technology is a pressing issue that must be investigated. By processing these heterogeneous large-scale learning records and integrating multiple perspectives to analyze this learning record information to identify students' learning behaviors, this study proposes an integrated analysis algorithm based on artificial intelligence information technology. The possible learning outcomes of students are predicted based on their current learning situation, so teachers can provide auxiliary teaching strategies to students who may have learning difficulties based on the predicted information. The method proposed in this article uses information technology to predict students' grades, and the analysis shows that the method is very effective. In this article, different grades of classification methods are used to analyze and predict the whole students. All grade classification methods are effective in describing decision rules. No matter what grades classification method is used, the error rate of students' grades distribution is predicted to be below 40%.  © 2022 Yushu Guan.",,Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Knowledge; Learning;

Effective analysis of student interaction is crucial for enhancing teaching quality and optimizing the learning experience in these digitally enriched environments. Traditional analysis frameworks often face challenges such as inaccuracies in anomaly detection and inefficiencies in data handling, particularly when handling extensive datasets typical of online platforms. This study introduces a novel approach to enhancing student interaction analysis systems by leveraging the synergy between machine learning and advanced interactive mobile technologies. Initially, the study proposes an advanced anomaly detection method tailored for identifying irregu-lar student interactions. This method utilizes a blend of machine learning algorithms and the real-time data processing capabilities of mobile technology. Furthermore, to address the complexities of data transmission in mobile-based online education ecosystems, a state-of-the-art congestion control algorithm has been developed. This algorithm optimizes data flow, significantly enhancing transmission stability and efficiency. The integration of interactive mobile technology with machine learning offers a robust and dynamic framework for analyzing student interactions, thereby facilitating a more engaging and effective online educational experience. This research contributes to the advancement of online education quality and efficiency by emphasizing the role of interactive mobile technology in shaping future learning environments. © 2024 by the authors of this article.",anomaly detection; congestion control; interactive mobile technology; machine learning integration; mobile data transmission optimization; online education platforms; student interaction analysis,Computer aided instruction; Data communication systems; Data transfer; E-learning; Efficiency; Engineering education; Integration; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Quality control; Students; Telecommunication equipment; Anomaly detection; Congestion control; Data-transmission; Interaction analysis; Interactive mobile technology; Machine learning integration; Machine-learning; Mobile data; Mobile data transmission optimization; Mobile Technology; On-line education; Online education platform; Optimisations; Student interaction analyse; Student interactions; Anomaly detection,,,,,,,"Singh A.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate home-based teaching quality via Network. Based on the analytic hierarchy process, this paper selects five indicators, i.e. learning users, teaching content, teaching methods, teaching platform and teaching effect, to build an evaluation system of online teaching effect and evaluate online teaching quality. It is shown that the impact of the home environment under the student user criterion module, the perfect teaching platform function under the teaching platform criterion module, and the student learning requirements under the student user criterion module have the most significant impact on the effect of online teaching in the evaluation system, while the basic knowledge is less influential. The evaluation system provides technical support for the evaluation of online teaching effects.  © 2020 IEEE.",Analytic Hierarchy Process; evaluation system; online teaching quality,Analytic hierarchy process; Information management; Learning systems; Quality control; Students; Home environment; Ministry of Education; Network teaching; Online platforms; Teaching contents; Teaching methods; Teaching platform; Technical support; E-learning,,,,,,,"Notice of the Ministry OfEducation on the Issuance of The""Action Plan for Education Informatization 2; Bin D., High school mathematics classroom teaching quality evaluation based on AHP [J], Education Modernization, 2, pp. 51-54, (2019); Xinrui Z., Yuqing Z., Linyun Q., Zhihong Z., Construction of MOOC teaching quality evaluation index system of college physics based on AHP [J], Physics and Engineering, 115, pp. 1-54, (2018); Jian K., Yang H., Xiao L., Research on the Evaluation and Optimization Countermeasures of Network Teaching Information Ecosystem in Universities[J], 7, pp. 45-56, (2019); Nan S., Lijun X., Zilong W., Yinghong G., Evaluation analysis of network teaching effect based on AHP[J], Theoretical Research, 11, pp. 20-21, (2017)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"2020 International Conference on Modern Education and Information Management, ICMEIM 2020",18 September 2020 through 20 September 2020,Changsha,168291.0,,978-172819623-7,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

The core idea of this paper is to map the connection between teaching practices to student learning in an online environment. Face to face evaluation techniques are fairly quick and easy for formative assessments to check student understanding in existent environment. Prevailing studies illustrate that a person's facial expressions and emotions are closely related. In order to make the teaching-learning process more effective, teachers usually collect day to day feedback from the students. This feedback can be used to improve teaching skills and make the process more interactive. In a virtual learning mode, there is a need to identify and understand the emotions of people. Constructive information can be extracted from online platforms using facial recognition algorithms. An online course connected with students is used for examination; the results have shown that this technique performs strongly.  © 2021 IEEE.",Emotion analysis; facial landmark points; lecture feedback; MTCNN; student involvement; teacher assessment,E-learning; Face recognition; Education systems; Emotion analysis; Facial landmark; Facial landmark point; Lecture feedback; MTCNN; On-line education; Student emotions; Student involvements; Teacher assessments; Students,,,,,,,"Wang W., Xu K., Niu H., Miao X., Emotion recognition of students based on facial expressions in online education based on the perspective of computer simulation, Hindawi Complexity, 2020, pp. 1-9, (2020); Darwin C., Prodger P., The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, (1998); Tian Y.-I., Kanade T., Cohn J.F., Recognizing action units for facial expression analysis, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 23, 2, pp. 97-115, (2001); Goodfellow J., Erhan D., Carrier P.L., Et al., Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests, Neural Information Processing, pp. 117-124, (2013); Zeng Z., Pantic M., Roisman G.I., Huang T.S., A survey of affect recognition methods: Audio, visual, and spontaneous expressions, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 31, 1, pp. 39-58, (2009); Sariyanidi E., Gunes H., Cavallaro A., Automatic analysis of facial affect: A survey of registration, representation, and Complexity 7 recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37, 6, pp. 1113-1133, (2015); Martinez B., Valstar M.F., Advances, challenges, and opportunities in automatic facial expression recognition, Advances in Face Detection and Facial Image Analysis, pp. 63-100, (2016); Devi Burri R., Manvitha Enadula S., Devi Odugu R., Prasad V.B.V.N., Decision making for common stock selection using Regression Techniques, Test Engineering and Management, 83, (2020); Gunes H., Schuller B., Categorical and dimensional affect analysis in continuous input: Current trends and future directions, Image and Vision Computing, 31, 2, pp. 120-136, (2013); Li S., Deng W., Deep facial expression recognition: A survey, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing; Wang M., Deng W., Deep Face Recognition: A Survey; Devi Burri R., Burri R., Reddy Bojja R., Buraga S., Insurance claim analysis using machine learning algorithms, International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE), 8, 6 S4, (2019); Lin J., Zhou T., Chen Z., DeepIR: A Deep Semantics Driven Framework for Image Retargeting; Zhang K., Zhang Z., Li Z., Joint Face Detection and Alignment Using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks; Devi Burri R., Madhuri A., Sai Raghavendra D.N., A multi resolution convolution neural network based face recognition analysis, Journal of Critical Reviews, 7, 18, (2020); Triantafyllidou D., Tefas A., A fast deep convolutional neural network for face detection in big visual data, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, (2017); Zeng Z., Pantic M., Roisman G.I., Huang T.S., A survey of affect recognition methods: Audio, visual, and spontaneous expressions, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis AndMachine Intelligence, 31, 1, pp. 39-58, (2009); Sariyanidi E., Gunes H., Cavallaro A., Automatic analysis of facial affect: A survey of registration, representation, and Complexity 7 recognition, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 37, 6, pp. 1113-1133, (2015); Zhang N., Gao W., Luo J., Research on face detection technology based on MTCNN, 2020 International Conference on Computer Network, Electronic and Automation (ICCNEA)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"4th International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies, ICECCT 2021",15 September 2021 through 17 September 2021,Erode,175062.0,,978-166541480-7,,,English,"Int.

The sudden shift of teaching mode has resulted in unplanned challenges. The main concerns among teachers and students include teaching quality and learning effectiveness. To examine the effectiveness of interpreting teaching and learning online, we conducted a survey about students' perceptions of satisfaction concerning online interpreting teaching and learning via an online platform. This survey is composed of questions to measure student satisfaction from six aspects, namely, instructor, technology, setup, interaction, outcomes, and overall. Results showed that the shift to abrupt online interpreting teaching and learning did not have any significant impact on teaching quality and learning effectiveness. Findings also highlighted the need for further investigation of self-regulation and self-directiveness in online interpreting teaching and learning. Essential pedagogical tasks can be conducted online (e.g., triangulation exercises, relays, handover, and channel switching).

The traditional face-to-face learning mode has been switched to online (distance) learning, causing various influences on students' academic performance. As higher education plays a central role in technology innovation and society development, it is of great importance to investigate and improve online education in the context of COVID-19. This study distributed online questionnaires to college students from 30 provinces or municipalities in China to evaluates the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) factors of shifting from traditional learning to online learning during COVID-19 Pandemic. The SWOT analysis has been employed to construct 16 kind of internal and external evaluation factors and 4 kind of improvement strategies for assess online education. The basic data of subjective weight method - AHP comes from the questionnaire survey, and the weight value of SWOT factors are determined through the questionnaire survey results. The fuzzy MARCOS approach is used to select the most suitable strategies for its effective implementation. Several coping strategies are suggested to improve the online education in post-pandemic era, which is essential for higher education and promoting a civilized and sustainable society. 'By reforming and innovating the teacher led teaching mode, stimulate students' interest in learning, get rid of the boring learning state, create a good learning atmosphere and improve the teaching quality' is the most effective strategy to enhance the online learning experience and increase students' satisfaction. This methodology is applicable with a case study concerning the students' online education in pandemic and the validity of this approach is presented through comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis. Through example verification, it is found that SWOT method is suitable for online education evaluation research no matter how the research object changes.  © 2013 IEEE.",COVID-19 pandemic; fuzzy AHP; fuzzy MARCOS; online education; SWOT analysis,Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Hierarchical systems; Online systems; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Students; Surveys; Teaching; COVID-19 pandemic; Distance-learning; Electronic learning; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy MARCOS; Mobile Learning; On-line education; Pandemic; Psychology; Social networking (online); Strength analysis; Threats analysis; COVID-19,,,,,,,"Chang J.Y.-F., Wang L.-H., Lin T.-C., Cheng F.-C., Chiang C.-P., Comparison of learning effectiveness between physical classroom and online learning for dental education during the COVID-19 pandemic, J.

However, there are critical opinions that question the contribution of student interaction to real learning. This study applies learning analytics and data mining techniques to explore the online discussion forums of 362 business students at the bachelor and master levels, who participated in business simulation games between 2011 and 2016. The findings revealed that the most frequent contents in the students’ online discussion forums were related, firstly, to the parameters and features of the business simulation game, and, secondly, to elements that fostered the students’ learning process, while small talk or regular conversation did not appear to be relevant. In addition, the contents with predictive power over learning results were related to uncertainty, time, interaction, communication and collaboration, although none of these elements influenced teacher assessment of student learning. This study reveals the usefulness of learning analytics tools to gain a more wide and holistic view of the learning process of students, discovering new aspects that affect students’ learning results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Business simulation games; Data mining; Learning analytics; Learning outcomes; Online learning activities; Student interaction,Computer aided software engineering; Data mining; Learning systems; Online systems; Social networking (online); Students; Business simulation games; Learning analytics; Learning outcome; Online learning activities; Student interactions; article; conversation; data mining; human; human experiment; major clinical study; overlearning; simulation; student; teacher; uncertainty; E-learning,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (780262); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO","AP acknowledges the support of TEC2014-60337-R grants from the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (MINECO).

Using the Student's Evaluation of Online Teaching Effectiveness (SEOTE) scale, a survey was conducted among 1042 students in different Indian universities. The scale measured student faculty contact (SFC), cooperation among students (CAS), active learning (AL), prompt feedback (PF), time on task (TT), high expectations (HE), and diverse talents and ways of learning (DTWL). The research instrument also included three open-ended questions. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Human Development Index (HDI). The Online Teaching Effectiveness Index (OTEI) value was moderate at 0.62. Challenging aspects of online education were found to be access, learning experience, technology, resources, and infrastructure, the need for face-to-face interaction, and the health hazards of long screen time. The survey of 60 faculty members recorded online teaching to be sustainable, backed by institute support, flexible, and creates the possibility of peer learning. Lack of training resources, unsuitability of course design and practical courses for online mode, and the need for an overhaul of pedagogy were the challenges. Policymakers and digital companies should include infrastructural changes and investments at both the institutional and digital platforms level. © 2023 The Authors.

Therefore, a social network-based evaluation method for educational and teaching effectiveness in universities is proposed. First, we analyse the role of teaching effectiveness evaluation and design the principles for constructing a teaching effectiveness evaluation index system. Then, we calculate the entropy matching degree of evaluation indicators, set consistency criteria for evaluation indicators, and use SVM algorithm to classify evaluation indicators, constructing an evaluation indicator system. Finally, we construct a social network for teaching effectiveness evaluation, determine the subgroup cohesion of evaluation indicators, construct an education and teaching effectiveness evaluation function, and obtain the evaluation results. The experimental results show that the confidence level of the evaluation results of this method is high, and the matching error of the entropy value of the evaluation indicators is low.  © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",entropy matching degree; indicator system; social network; the effectiveness of higher education and teaching,Economic and social effects; Entropy; Effectiveness evaluation; Entropy matching; Entropy matching degree; Evaluation indicators; High educations; Indicators systems; Matching degree; Social network; Teaching effectiveness; The effectiveness of high education and teaching; Quality control,,,,,,,"Cilliers J., Fleisch B., Kotze J., Mohohlwane M., Taylor S., The challenge of sustaining effective teaching: spillovers, fade-out, and the cost-effectiveness of teacher development programs, Economics of Education Review, 87, 2, pp. 1-10, (2022); Ding X., Salam Z.A., Lv W., Research on timeliness evaluation model of online teaching based on intelligent learning, International Journal of Continuing Engineering Education and Life-Long Learning, 31, 2, pp. 263-275, (2021); Du P., An English teaching ability evaluation model based on edge computing, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 36, 3, pp. 1-8, (2022); Fan P., Application of deep learning and cloud data platform in college teaching quality evaluation, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology, 41, 5, pp. 5770-5779, (2020); Gao B., Research and implementation of intelligent evaluation system of teaching quality in universities based on artificial intelligence neural network model, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 12, 5, pp. 1-10, (2022); Huang J., An internet of things evaluation algorithm for quality assessment of computer-based teaching, Mobile Information Systems, 13, 2, pp. 1-10, (2021); Ibrahim H., The satisfaction of students about how instructional design quality criteria for e-course in distance learning, International Journal of Educational Technology and Learning, 8, 2, pp. 70-82, (2020); Ji S., Tsai S.B., A study on the quality evaluation of English teaching based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of bat algorithm and big data analysis, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 65, 43, pp. 1-12, (2021); Li G., Liu F., Wang Y., Guo Y., Xiao L., Zhu L., A convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for the recognition and evaluation of classroom teaching behavior, Scientific Programming, 41, 9, pp. 1-8, (2021); Liu G., Zhuang H., Evaluation model of multimedia-aided teaching effect of physical education course based on random forest algorithm, Journal of Intelligent Systems, 31, 1, pp. 555-567, (2022); Luo R., Liao Q., Zheng J., Zhao L., A study on the evaluation method of foreign language classroom teaching process from the perspective of neuroeducation, International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 20, 7, pp. 2092-2104, (2021); Su Y., Chen G., Li M., Shi T., Fang D., Design and implementation of web multimedia teaching evaluation system based on artificial intelligence and jQuery, Mobile Information Systems, 23, 12, pp. 1-12, (2021); Wang H., Du Y., Tsai S.B., Evaluation of the effectiveness computer-assisted language teaching by big data analysis, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 15, 9, pp. 1-11, (2021); Wu G., Zheng J., Zhai J., Individualized learning evaluation model based on hybrid teaching, International Journal of Electrical Engineering Education, 7, 2, pp. 8393-8399, (2021); Yang Y., Quality evaluation method of a mathematics teaching model reform based on an improved genetic algorithm, Scientific Programming, 33, 6, pp. 639-649, (2021); Yu H., Online teaching quality evaluation based on emotion recognition and improved AprioriTid algorithm, Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems: Applications in Engineering and Technology, 14, 4, pp. 40-45, (2021); Yuan F., Nie Y., Online classroom teaching quality evaluation system based on facial feature recognition, Scientific Programming, 39, 14, pp. 1-10, (2021); Zhang J., Addae H.M., Bakeman M., Management students' perceptions of online teaching quality, e-Journal of Business Education and Scholarship of Teaching, 14, 2, pp. 33-52, (2020)","Q.

The development of technology has made these online platforms more and more powerful, escorting the continuous development of online education. Colleges and universities, as the main front for the cultivation of high-quality talents in my country, have already introduced large-scale online courses into education and teaching, enriching the teaching content, and expanding the teaching form. In the face of new technical means and abundant online education resources, the teaching quality of online classrooms in colleges and universities is so low, which deserves our further reflection. For a long time, the effect of online classroom teaching in colleges and universities has been closely concerned by the academic community, but most of them start from external factors, ignoring the internal relationship of online classrooms. Clarifying the complex relationships in the online classroom field of colleges and universities and clarifying the rules of habitus and capital operation in the online classroom field of colleges and universities are the intrinsic motivation and important source to stimulate the vitality of the online classroom field of colleges and universities and improve the quality of teaching. By grasping the essence of classroom teaching and analyzing the inherent characteristics of the online classroom field, this research intends to clarify the proper state of the online classroom field, and to explore the reasons why the current online classroom field function has not been fully realized, so as to find the depth of college education.  © 2022 Qianqian Zhao and Yan Li.",,E-learning; Classroom teaching; College education; Colleges and universities; Continuous development; Development mechanisms; Field theory; Full-swing; On-line education; Online classroom; Online platforms; Curricula,,,,,,,"Bonk C.J., Kim K.J., Zeng T., Future directions of blended learning in higher education and workplace learning settings, pp. 3644-3649; Bourdeau D.T., Griffith K.V., Griffith J.C., Griffith J.C., An investigation of the relationshipbetween grades and learning mode in an English composition course, Journal ofUniversity Teaching & Learning Practice, 15, 2, (2018); Bourdieu P., Richardson J., The forms of capital, Handbook of Theory and Research for the Sociology of Education, pp. 69-72, (1986); Clark C., Strudler N., Grove K., Comparing asynchronous and synchronous video vs.TextBased discussions in an online teacher education course, Journal of AsynchronousLearning Net-work, 19, 3, pp. 84-96, (2015); Jonassen D.H., Learning to Solve Problems with Technology:AConstructivist Perspective, (2002); Faulconer E.K., Griffith J., Wood B., Acharyya S., Roberts D., A comparison of online, video synchronous, and traditional learning modes for an introductory undergraduate physics course, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 27, 5, pp. 404-411, (2018); Francescucci A., Foster M., The VIRI (virtual, interactive, real-time, instructor-led) classroom: the impact of blended synchronous online courses on student performance, engagement, and satisfaction, Canadian Journal of Higher Education, 43, 3, pp. 78-91, (2013); Francescucci A., Rohani L., Exclusively synchronous online (VIRI) learning: the impact on student performance and engagement outcomes, Journal of Marketing Education, 43, 3, pp. 78-91, (2018); Gedera D., SPStudents ' experiences of learning in a virtual classroom [J], International Journal of Education and Development Using Information and Communication Technology, 10, 4, pp. 93-101, (2014); Skylar A.A., Comparison of asynchronous online text-based lectures and SynchronousInteractive web conferencing lectures, Issues in Teacher Education, 18, 2, pp. 69-84, (2009); Spector J.M., Conceptualizing the emerging field of smart learning environments, Smart Learning Environments, 1, 1, pp. 2-10, (2014); Quigley C., Patrick J., Globalization's Contradictions; Geographies of Discipline,destruction and transformation, (2007); Pasco R.J., Capital and Opportunity: A Critical Ethnography of High School Students At-Risk, (2003); Norton D.W., The strategic technical communicator: a critical action inquiry of information architecture, Social Affairs, 24, 5, pp. 22-23, (2001); Weininger E.B., Lareau A., Translating Bourdieu into the American context: the question of social class and family-school relations, Poetics, 31, 5-6, pp. 375-402, (2003); Marinetto M., Who wants to be an active citizen?, Sociology, 37, 1, pp. 103-120, (2003); Forde C., Martin S., Galvin A.D., Children and young people's right to participate: national and local youth councils in Ireland, The International Journal of Children's Rights, 24, 1, pp. 135-154, (2016); Quigley C., Patrick J., Globalization's contradictions; Geographies of discipline, destruction and transformation, 97, 4, pp. 802-804, (2007); Gerissdoerfer M., Savaget P., Evans S., The Cambridge Business Model Innovation Process, Procedia Manufacturing, 8, pp. 262-269, (2017); Zhou P., Zhang Y., Analysis and Thinking on the Current Situation of Student Participation in Online Teaching Platforms, Journal of Nanjing Radio and Television University, 33, 2, pp. 40-43+81, (2010); Zhu Q., Lu F.L., The formation of media weakness and its rescue for vulnerable groups in the perspective ""concept, Social Sciences, 44, 6, (2005); Zhu Y., Han X., Yang J., Cheng J., Higher education with the help of online development has become an irreversible trend-a comprehensive analysis of the 11-year series of reports on online education in the United States and enlightenment, Tsinghua University Education Research, 35, 4, pp. 92-100, (2014)","Q.

The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the learning behavior data from 44 students specializing in computer-related subjects on the online platform of the 'Introduction to Computational Thinking' course, utilizing clustering algorithms. Subsequently, we utilized the Pearson correlation coefficient method to delve into the intricate relationship between diverse behavioral traits and academic performance. Our research has revealed that cluster analysis is adept at discerning behavioral disparities among students. Specifically, we identified four types of learning groups with different learning characteristics. Furthermore, a notable correlation was observed between homework scores and key evaluation metrics, including academic performance.

With the development of mathematical science, people have a deeper understanding of it, and the idea of optimization into various fields. Optimization theory has become an important subject in recent years and has been widely used in many important fields. With the improvement of science and technology, computer and network technology has been popularized in every corner of social life. Since the spring of 2020, in the face of the impact of the novel coronavirus epidemic, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice of 'using online platforms to suspend classes without stopping school', and large, primary and secondary schools across the country are taking part in online teaching. The implementation of online teaching has rapidly changed the teaching methods of teachers and students. The changes of learning environment, learning platform and teaching methods have also brought new challenges to teachers. Therefore, in order to solve the problems accompanying online teaching, improve the effect of online teaching of mathematics, in order to help mathematics teachers more accurate and efficient online teaching work. In this paper, an online mathematics teaching quality testing system based on optimization algorithm is proposed. The AMM algorithm is used in the numerical experiment. Thirdly, the improved algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with the classical gradient descent optimization algorithm, which proves that the algorithm is feasible and efficient. The experimental results show that the combination of optimization algorithm and big data technology can better realize the online teaching quality detection, but also help students to obtain better learning experience and effect.  © 2023 IEEE.",AMM algorithm; mathematics online teaching; optimization algorithm; quality test,Computer aided instruction; Coronavirus; E-learning; Engineering education; Gradient methods; Learning systems; Optimization; Teaching; AMM algorithm; Mathematic online teaching; Online teaching; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Quality test; Teachers'; Teaching methods; Teaching quality; Test systems; Site selection,,,,,"Xi'an Innovation College of Yan'an University, (ZYRC202208)",Fund 2: The project of Xi'an Innovation College of Yan'an University for cultivating outstanding talents (Project No. ZYRC202208).,"OmaeY M.M., Akiduki T., Et al., A NOVEL DEEP LEARNING OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM FOR HUMAN MOTIONS ANOMALY DETECTION, International Journal of Innovative Computing Information and Control, 15, 1, pp. 199-208, (2019); Al-Andoli M., Cheah W.P., Tan S.C., Deep autoencoder-based community detection in complex networks with particle swarm optimization and continuation algorithms, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 40, 1, pp. 1-17, (2021); Mu R., Multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithm based on decomposition for community detection in complex networks, Soft computing: A fusion of foundations, methodologies and applications, 59, 26, pp. 12136-12143, (2019); Shao B., Jinneng H.E., Bian G., Research on Replica Layout Algorithm Based on Multi-objective Decomposition Strategy, Journal of Frontiers of Computer Science and Technology, 14, 9, pp. 1490-1500, (2020); Soni B., Roy S., Warsi S., Particle Swarm Optimization in Bioinformatics, Image Processing, and Computational Linguistics, International journal of swarm intelligence research, 12, 4, pp. 25-44, (2021); Ali H., Albagul A., Algitta A., Optimization of PID Parameters based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Ball and Beam System, International Journal of Engineering Technologies and Management Research, 18, 11, pp. 147-150, (2018); Sevinc E., Cosar A., An Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm for Optimization of Distributed Database Queries, Computer Journal, 54, 5, pp. 717-725, (2018); Yong L., Qingsong J., Zhongyao L., Zhen W., Xiaoyu L., Qiuyuan F., Rui Z., Huaicheng G., Lake eutrophication responses modeling and watershed management optimization algorithm: A review, Journal of Lake Sciences, 33, 1, pp. 49-63, (2021); Najah W., Solving Job-Shop Scheduling Problem Using a Developed PSO Algorithm, International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR), 7, 1, pp. 1845-1848, (2018); Rahimian P., Behnam S., A Novel Data-driven and Feature-based Forecasting Framework for Wasted Water (NRW) Optimization of Network Pressure Management System, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 31, 3, pp. 423-433, (2020); Ahmed G., Sheltami T., Mahmoud A., Et al., IoD swarms collision avoidance via improved particle swarm optimization, Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice, 142, pp. 260-278, (2020); Ijjina E.P., Classification of human actions using pose-based features and stacked auto encoder, Pattern Recognition Letters, 83, pp. 268-277, (2016)","X.

One of them is in educational institutions. The application of New Normal with its social distancing has made learning carried out remotely. The implementation of distance learning in schools needs an innovation through the use of Information and Communication Technology in learning. There are several Information and Communication Technology media that can be used in learning including computers and the internet. Teachers can design subject matter using computers. Then the material that has been designed is delivered to students via the internet network. Currently, there are many social media that support distance learning. SDIT Cahaya Hati has also conducted distance learning. Teachers need to prepare distance learning material in advance before it is delivered to students. This study aims to reveal the use of Information and Communication Technology by SDIT Cahaya Hati teachers in distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The type of this research is qualitative with interview data collection techniques, and documentation. The results show that the Cahaya Hati SDIT teachers have organized distance learning using Information and Communication Technology media. SDIT Cahaya Hati teachers use computers to make learning materials in the form of power points and learning videos. This material is delivered to students using the internet network through a WhatsApp group. Every day the teacher evaluates the learning and once a week the assignment is handed over to the teacher at school  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Distance Learning, and Information Communication Technology",Distance education; Information use; Can design; Data collection; Educational institutions; Information and Communication Technologies; Learning materials; Power points; Social media; Subject matters; Students,,,,,,,"Habibi A., Normal Baru Pasca Covid-19, Journal.Uinjkt.Ac.Id, 4, pp. 197-202, (2020); Syah R.

Therefore, increase in student enrollment, retention and graduation rate is becoming very important, so is the need for effective teaching in these subjects. Many universities commonly use formal, institutional Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) systems to measure the teaching effectiveness. After each semester, through SET, students provide feedback and comments for their courses and instructors. However, evaluations are private and only a handful people have access to these. Therefore, these evaluations cannot be utilized to create a common understanding of the students' expectations, perspective, desired characteristics of the courses and instructors. On the other hand, third party online platforms like RateMyProfessor.com (RMP) are public, solicit anonymous student feedback and host tremendous amount of data about the instructors and their courses. These platforms are also popular among students. We mined and analyzed the RMP data for some research questions, e.g.: What are the common characteristics of the popular CS instructors? How different are they for the SE instructors? Are there any examples of special characteristics, tools and techniques popular CS instructors use? We captured and analyzed more than 9,000 students' comments for over 300 CS instructors for the top 20 universities in the U.S. and Canada. The paper contributes by presenting the findings for the research questions and making the data and the scripts available for public use for future research. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

What happens to the network when the classroom expectations change? For example, there is a coursework expectation that students exchange contact information, or the instructor uses collaborative learning practices. Or what if the principal investigator (PI) of a scientific team goes on a sabbatical? This study uses the framework of classrooms because of their relatability across science. We asked how do different instructor coursework expectations change network structures within a classroom or other learning environments? A social network survey was administered at the start and end of the semester (pre- and post-test) in six university sociology classrooms to explore how expectations impacted the communication and learning networks. We found practical changes in course expectations impact the communication and learning networks, suggesting that instructors, facilitators, and others could be the archintorTM (architect +instructor+facilitator) of the network. Understanding that expectations can impact a network’s structure marks a paradigm shift in educational assessment approaches. If the archintorTM has identified the “optimal” network structure, then their task is to design expectations that result in specific interactions that ultimately improve student achievement and success. This work provides recommendations for classroom archintorsTM to create the most impactful classroom networks. Future research should extend beyond education and classroom networks and identify the best or desired networks in other areas like public policy, urban planning, and more. If these “optimal” networks were identified, an archintorTM could design a social network to solve wicked problems, manage a crisis, and create social change. © 2023 Love et al.

However, online business ethics education faces a challenge in which the lack of communication among teachers and students leads to a decline in teaching effectiveness. Social media applications can be imbedded in traditional ethics education to solve this problem. In this paper, based on the elaboration likelihood model and social media capabilities theory, we develop an integrated model to explain how the change in students’ attitudes about corporate social responsibility (CSR) happens in a social media-supported environment and how social media capabilities affect the processes. We conducted a teaching experiment and collected 233 valid samples of students to verify the hypothesis. Our study confirmed there are two mechanisms to affect students’ attitudes about CSR, source credibility, and argument quality. Concurrency has a moderating effect on attitudes change. Possible reasons, limitations, implications, and advice for future studies are also presented. © 2019 Society for Research into Higher Education.",Attitudes about CSR; elaboration likelihood model; ethics education;

The application of the “hybrid” teaching model in online and offline college English teaching is the trend and the focus of local higher education reform. Nowadays, many universities at home and abroad have successively established online platforms and launched online courses, striving for seamless connection between online and offline classrooms. It can be seen that exploring the “blended” teaching mode of online and offline in local higher education institutions is a trend of the times and the current situation of English language classrooms in universities. The online and offline blended teaching effectiveness evaluation of college English courses is regarded as multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM). In this paper, the triangular fuzzy neutrosophic numbers grey relational analysis (TFNN-GRA) method is designed for MADM based on the classical point GRA and triangular fuzzy neutrosophic sets (TFNSs). Finally, a numerical example for online and offline blended teaching effectiveness evaluation of college English courses is given and some comparisons are done to show the advantages of TFNN-GRA method. © 2023 – IOS Press.

Social networks had a key role in supporting the educational community in facing challenges and opportunities. A quantitative study was conducted to assess the Greek teachers’ perceptions of social network support. Findings indicated that teachers turned to universities, educational institutions, the Ministry of Education, school support groups, and virtual communities for support. Additionally, the study revealed the barriers faced by teachers, including infrastructure limitations, technical difficulties, skill deficiencies, problems with students’ engagement, and school policies. Teachers’ evaluation of support regarding ERT provided fruitful insight. The results illustrate teachers’ perspectives on ERT, contributing to the ongoing discourse on educational resilience to unpredictable disruptions. In conclusion, the role of social networks was considered as critical for the teachers to overcome barriers during ERT with the formation of social communities for support and the sharing of common experiences. Expertise in internet use and social networking played a significant role in readiness for the abrupt shift to distance education. The present study uniquely contributes to the educational field by emphasizing the role of teachers’ support as an innovative approach to holistically enhance teachers’ performance in ERT. © 2024 by the authors.",emergency remote teaching; obstacles; pedagogy; social networks; sources of support; support,,,,,,"Educational Institution of Government; Ministry of Education, MOE","The present study uniquely contributes to the educational field by emphasizing the role of teachers\u2019 support as an innovative approach to holistically enhance teachers\u2019 performance in ERT. The findings of our study indicated that teachers sought technological, psychological, pedagogical, and communication-related support. Additionally, the results confirmed recent findings concerning the obstacles faced by teachers, including infrastructure limitations, technical difficulties, skill deficiencies, problems with students\u2019 participation, and school policies. Inevitably, teachers reached out for support from universities, the Educational Institution of Government and educational institutions, the Ministry of Education, school support groups, and online virtual communities. In summary, teachers\u2019 evaluation of support, digital capabilities, satisfaction with students\u2019 participation, and the importance of ERT provided insight into their experience. In conclusion, these findings shed light on teachers\u2019 perspectives regarding ERT, contributing to the ongoing discourse about educational resilience in the face of unpredictable disruptions. This study is mainly focused on ERT, which is different than distance learning. Distance learning heavily relies on the learner\u2019s self-regulation. They find their ways of learning through structured and tailored learning environments designed with time flexibility and content adaptability. Despite this limitation, current research has the potential to lay the groundwork for further research and the development of strategies to enhance teacher preparedness and support. The necessity for programs offering technical support to teachers, as well as training in pedagogical teaching methodologies and increasing the effectiveness of teaching efficiency through mentorship was shown. The integration of preventive strategies, such as incorporating technology support into instructional coaching, as well as implementing a system for delivering assistance based on stakeholder requests, data, or feedback, would be a valuable development. In addition, forthcoming research should prioritize the provision of support and guidance for teachers to adapt to novel teaching environments and technologies like path tracking systems to collect data while a particular software or application is being used and to foster their continued professional development and welfare.

The curriculum was divided into two segments. Initially, two groups were established for the first segment, covering an introduction to Biomolecular and Material Metabolism. The group A adopted a teaching strategy incorporating “massive open online course + a Social Media platform (WeChat) + Project/Problem-Based Learning + Flipped classroom”, integrating online and offline methods. The group B followed conventional teaching practices. In the second course segment, which included molecular biology and clinical biochemistry, the two groups had their instructional format switched. Comparative analysis of student satisfaction, learning attitudes, and academic performance between the groups was conducted. The satisfaction survey indicated that the group which adopted the online and offline mode outperformed the conventional teaching group in satisfaction rate, satisfaction scores, excellence rate, and total scores. While both groups exhibited an improvement in learning attitudes, the teaching reform group showed a significantly higher level of enhancement. Furthermore, the reform group achieved superior overall average scores, basic average scores, comprehensive average scores, and an increased rate of excellence compared to the conventional group. The results demonstrate that adopting a blended teaching model significantly improved instructional quality and positively influenced students' engagement and attitudes in biochemistry and molecular biology studies. © 2024 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.",biochemistry and molecular biology; online-and-offline teaching mode; teaching quality,,,,,,"Jiangsu Provincial Key Project of Educational Reform in China, (2021JSJG188); Jiangsu Provincial Higher Education Teaching Revolution Research Project in China, (2019JSJG509); Jiangsu Medical College, (Z202104)",This work was supported by Jiangsu Provincial Key Project of Educational Reform in China (No. 2021JSJG188); 2019 Jiangsu Provincial Higher Education Teaching Revolution Research Project in China (2019JSJG509); the construction project of high\u2010level professional group of higher vocational education in Jiangsu Province in China (Su Jianjiao Vocational Letter [2021] No. 1).

We offer results from an intercollegiate collaboration that provides an innovative learning environment through a social media education ecosystem. Participating students discuss current marketing topics with peers, marketing practitioners, and faculty to reinforce course concepts, improve learning perceptions, and increase professional communication skills and networking opportunities. An initial exploratory study provides a snapshot of Twitter analytics, illustrating the reach of students’ marketing-related discussions. Next, survey data collected from students show increased learning satisfaction and favorable behavioral intentions. Finally, tweets from the 12-week project were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Results suggest that participants improved their professional communication skills while using language that provokes greater cognitive processes. Implications for marketing educators and future directions for the project are also provided. © The Author(s) 2018.",experiential learning techniques; innovative teaching methods; measuring teaching effectiveness; skills/traits development in marketing education; surveys; written communication,,,,,,,,"Ackerman D.S., Gross B.L., Perner L., Instructor, student, and employer perception on preparing marketing students for changing business landscapes, Journal of Marketing Education, 25, pp. 46-56, (2003); Anderson L.W., Krathwohl D.R., A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives, (2001); Aviv R., Ravid G., Reciprocity analysis of online learning networks, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 9, 4, pp. 3-13, (2005); Bal A.S., Grewal D., Mills A., Ottley G., Engaging students with social media, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, pp. 190-203, (2015); Beaudreau S.A., Storandt M., Strube M.J., A comparison of narratives told by younger and older adults, Experimental Aging Research, 32, pp. 105-117, (2006); Blessing S.B., Blessing J.S., Fleck B.K., Using Twitter to reinforce classroom concepts, Teaching of Psychology, 39, pp. 268-271, (2012); Boyatzis R.E., Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, (1998); Brush C.G., Exploring the concept of an entrepreneurship education ecosystem, Innovative pathways for university entrepreneurship in the 21st century, pp. 25-39, (2014); Casey S., Nielsen Social Media Report, (2017); Chen J., Hsieh G., Mahmud J., Nichols J., Understanding individuals’ personal values from social media word use, pp. 405-414, (2014); Clarke T.B., Nelson C.L., Classroom community, pedagogical effectiveness, and learning outcomes associated with Twitter use in undergraduate marketing courses, Journal for Advancement of Marketing Education, 20, pp. 29-38, (2012); Cohn M.A., Mehl M.R., Pennebaker J.W., Linguistic markers of psychological change surrounding, Psychological Science, 15, 10, pp. 687-693, (2004); Crittenden V., Crittenden W., Digital and Social Media Marketing in Business Education: Implications for the Marketing Curriculum, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, 3, pp. 131-132, (2015); Dowell D.J., Small F.A., What is the impact of online resource materials on student self-learning strategies?, Journal of Marketing Education, 33, pp. 140-148, (2011); Duffy K., Ney J., Exploring the divides among students, educators, and practitioners in the use of digital media as a pedagogical tool, Journal of Marketing Education, 37, pp. 104-113, (2015); Dunham K., The beginner’s guide to social media metrics: Engagement, (2014); Dunlap J.C., Lowenthal P.R., Tweeting the night away: Using Twitter to enhance social presence, Journal of Information Systems Education, 20, pp. 129-135, (2009); Fishbein M., Ajzen I., Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research, (1975); Gao F., Luo T., Zhang K., Tweeting for learning: A critical analysis of research on microblogging in education published in 2008–2011, British Journal of Educational Technology, 43, pp. 783-801, (2012); Hancock J.T., Beaver D.I., Chung C.K., Frazee J., Pennebaker J.W., Graesser A., Cai Z., Social language processing: A framework for analyzing the communication of terrorists and authoritarian regimes, Behavioral Sciences of Terrorism & Political Aggression, 2, pp. 108-132, (2010); Handelsman M.M., Briggs W.L., Sullivan N., Towler A., A measure of college student course engagement, Journal of Educational Research, 98, pp. 184-192, (2005); Heiberger G., Harper R., Have you Facebooked Astin lately?

Based on the analysis of previous studies on teaching, this study aims to propose a formal model for the evaluation of teaching strategies in four dimensions: sustainability, usability, accessibility, and creativity. The use of information technologies to measure teaching strategies can bring decisive advantages. This work has been inspired by social rating systems of social networks to propose a measurement system in which a potential large number of evaluators with different levels assess the strategies. In addition, the proposal also includes the evaluation of the evaluators' own work, assigning confidence levels that are based on their experience but also on their evaluations. In this way, we have a social measurement system, in the sense that participation is open to a large number of evaluators. A large community of teacher evaluators will increase the objectivity of the measurement. The outcome of the system will be a characterization of the teaching strategies that will allow to decide in the future which ones should be adopted according to the needs of each one. © The Author(s) 2022.",Accessibility; Evaluation model; Multidimensional evaluation; Sustainability; Teaching strategy; Usability,Information use; Sustainable development; Accessibility; Evaluation models; Formal modeling; Four dimensions; Measurement system; Multi-dimensional evaluations; Social ratings; Teachers'; Teaching strategy; Usability; COVID-19,,,,,,,"Guzman-Duque A., Las Crisis Una Oportunidad Para El Futuro De La educación Superior, (2021); Tang Y.M., Chen P.C., Law K.M.Y., Wu C.H., Lau Y., Guan J., He D., Ho G.T.S., Comparative analysis of student’s live online learning readiness during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the higher education sector, Comput.

While previous studies have demonstrated the utility of Facebook for enhancing student engagement, little is known about whether there are different profiles of students with different engagement patterns in the Facebook learning environment. Adopting a person-centred approach, we aim to fill this gap in the current study by identifying unobserved sub-populations of students with respect to their engagement patterns in the Facebook as a supplemental learning platform. Latent profile analysis revealed three engagement profiles, a minimally engaged, a moderately engaged, and a highly engaged profile. Results also suggested that academic disciplines and teacher involvement in the Facebook learning activities were significant predictors of student membership in the three engagement profiles. Our findings offer implications for the design and delivery of Facebook learning activities that cater to different groups of learners with different learning needs. © The Author(s) 2021.",Facebook learning platform; latent profile analysis; profile membership; student engagement,,,,,,,,"Appleton J.J., Christenson S.L., Furlong M.J., Student engagement with school: Critical conceptual and methodological issues of the construct, Psychology in the Schools, 45, 5, pp. 369-386, (2008); Appleton J.J., Christenson S.L., Kim D., Reschly A.L., Measuring cognitive and psychological engagement: Validation of the student engagement instrument, Journal of School Psychology, 44, 5, pp. 427-445, (2006); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Exploratory structural equation modeling, Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 16, 3, pp. 397-438, (2009); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Auxiliary variables in mixture modeling: Three-step approaches using M plus, Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 21, 3, pp. 329-341, (2014); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Morin A.J., Bayesian structural equation modeling with cross-loadings and residual covariances: Comments on Stromeyer et al, Journal of Management, 41, 6, pp. 1561-1577, (2015); Awidi I.T., Paynter M., Vujosevic T., Facebook group in the learning design of a higher education course: An analysis of factors influencing positive learning experience for students, Computers & Education, 129, pp. 106-121, (2019); Bae C.L., DeBusk-Lane M., Middle school engagement profiles: Implications for motivation and achievement in science, Learning and Individual Differences, 74, (2019); Bae C.L., DeBusk-Lane M.L., Lester A.M., Engagement profiles of elementary students in urban schools, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 62, (2020); Ben-Eliyahu A., Moore D., Dorph R., Schunn C.D., Investigating the multidimensionality of engagement: Affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement across science activities and contexts, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 53, pp. 87-105, (2018); Bergdahl N., Nouri J., Fors U., Knutsson O., Engagement, disengagement and performance when learning with technologies in upper secondary school, Computers & Education, 149, (2020); Bergman L.R., Andersson H., The person and the variable in developmental psychology, Zeitschrift Für Psychologie / Journal of Psychology, 218, 3, pp. 155-165, (2010); Blumenfeld P., Modell J., Bartko W.T., Secada W.G., Fredricks J.A., Friedel J., Paris A., School engagement of inner-city students during middle childhood, Developmental pathways through Middle childhood: Rethinking contexts and diversity as resources, pp. 145-170, (2005); Bowman N.D., Akcaoglu M., I see smart people!”: Using Facebook to supplement cognitive and affective learning in the university mass lecture, The Internet and Higher Education, 23, pp. 1-8, (2014); Collins L.M., Lanza S.T., Latent class and latent transition analysis: With applications in the social, behavioral, and health sciences, (2009); Connell J.P., Context, self, and action: A motivational analysis of self-system processes across the life span, The Self in Transition: Infancy to Childhood, 8, pp. 61-97, (1990); Connell J., Welborn J., Competence, autonomy and relatedness: A motivational analysis of self-system processes, Self processes in development: Minnesota symposium on child psychology, pp. 43-40, (1991); Cunha F.R.D., van Kruistum C., van Oers B., Teachers and Facebook: Using online groups to improve students’ communication and engagement in education, Communication Teacher, 30, 4, pp. 228-241, (2016); Datu J.A.D., Yang W., Valdez J.P.M., Chu S.K.W., Is Facebook involvement associated with academic engagement among Filipino university students?

Digital media technology helps present information in transmitting knowledge or skills, reduces cognitive load, and promotes understanding of knowledge. Evaluation of the effectiveness of digital media teaching has also become important. A scientific and reasonable evaluation of digital media teaching effectiveness can help teachers select digital media technology and grasp the amount, degree, and timing of digital media use to change teaching effectiveness. This paper proposed using a combination of big data and artificial intelligence methods to evaluate the effectiveness of digital media teaching methods using the RBF neural network model. The digital media teaching effectiveness evaluation was used as the input variable of RBF, the degree of digital media effectiveness was the output variable and the neural network was trained through the collected sample data. The research results showed that the RBF neural network model proposed in this paper has a strong generalization and extension ability in evaluating digital media teaching effectiveness, providing a new way to evaluate digital media teaching effectiveness.  © 2022 RuiYao Zhang.",,"Artificial Intelligence;

In order to quantify the effectiveness of knowledge transmission and mastery in digital media teaching, this paper proposes an improved Bayesian knowledge tracking model (BF-BKT), which has been specifically optimized for teaching quality evaluation. The motivation stems from the shortcomings of existing technology in evaluating teaching quality, especially the lack of effective integration of student learning behavior and forgetting patterns. This article describes the development process of the BF-BKT model, which innovatively combines learning behavior data and forgetting patterns by introducing behavioral forgetting features to more accurately predict students’ learning status and teaching effectiveness. The BF-BKT model not only considers whether students have mastered a certain knowledge point, but also further analyzes their forgetting situation at different time points, providing a more comprehensive perspective for evaluating teaching quality. To validate the performance of the BF-BKT model, we compared it with the traditional BKT model and two diverse BKT variants. We conducted systematic experiments and analysis by selecting public datasets as simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the BF-BKT model performs well in predicting students’ knowledge mastery and evaluating teaching quality, and its performance is superior to other comparative methods, proving the effectiveness and superiority of the model. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Bayesian knowledge tracking; behavioral modeling; teaching quality evaluation,Adversarial machine learning; Bayesian; Bayesian knowledge tracking; Behavioral model; Learning behavior; Performance; Quality evaluation; Student learning; Teaching quality; Teaching quality evaluation; Tracking models; Contrastive Learning,,,,,"Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund Project: Digital restoration of temple murals and construction of virtual museum in Shaanxi temple, (22022J026)",This work was supported by Shaanxi Provincial Social Science Fund Project: Digital restoration of temple murals and construction of virtual museum in Shaanxi temple (No. 22022J026).,"Guo Z., Yu K., Bashir A.K., Zhang D., Al-Otaibi Y.D., Guizani M., Deep information fusion-driven POI scheduling for mobile social networks, IEEE Netw, 36, 4, pp. 210-216, (2022); Hong J.-W., Curran N.M., Artificial intelligence, artists, and art: Attitudes toward artwork produced by humans vs. Artificial intelligence, ACM Trans.

However, concerns arouse when the result of SET and students' final grades are highly positively correlated, which means the students may make the evaluation based on the final grades they take. For the purpose of avoiding retaliation and mutual reward rating, some methods based on statistics or rules are used to detect the presence of anomaly evaluation. Whereas, the problem is still challenging since the characteristics of this abnormal evaluation are implicit and multimodal. Besides, additional information such as the domain of subject, instructors' teaching style, and the reputation spread by students also requires corresponding prior knowledge to supplement the abnormal evaluation detection model. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a multimodal embedding and prior knowledge based neural network to detect potential so called Interest Factor Influenced Abnormal Evaluation (IFAE). The method proposed in this paper uses SDNE and PV-DM to embed the evaluation network between students and teachers and the comment text of students. Taking into account the continuity of mutual evaluation between students and teachers during the teaching cycles and the different emphasis of students' comment texts on teachers, the features of students and teachers are comprehensively constructed. Then, the attention mechanism is used in the comment text to perform final prediction jointly with above features. The experiment result shows that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-art models which based on single type of features on F1 score by 9.25%. © 2019 IEEE.",Abnormal evaluation detection; Fusion of multimodal feature; Interest factor influenced abnormal evaluation; Priori knowledge; Student evaluation of teaching,Big data; Cloud computing; Embeddings; Knowledge based systems; Neural networks; Social networking (online); Attention mechanisms; Detection models; Multi-modal; Mutual evaluations; Prior knowledge; Priori knowledge; Student evaluation; Teaching styles; Students,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61371194); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), (2012CB720700, 2013CB329303)","The authors would to thank the academic affairs Office of Minnan Normal University for accessing their student evaluation of teaching database.

A previously unknown online community of scholars and their readers—who combine to form networks—can be uncovered by analyzing the works of prominent communication researchers across different formats and monitoring their online activities. The Altmetric.com and Dimensions.ai databases have recently received recognition in the fields of academic evaluation and scientific communication due to their extensive and innovative offline and online coverage. This study employs Altmetric.com and Dimensions.ai to classify four platforms on a quadruple helix—knowledge, social media, policy, and news channels—into actionable groups based on the “helix-based space and circulation” concept. This study’s assessment of online participation in the dissemination and the integration of ICA Fellows’ research also benefits from the use of sentiment analysis and semantic networks. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024.",Altmetrics;

However, the complex, intensive, and noisy nature of process data makes it challenging to model with the traditional psychometric methods. Social network methods have been applied to visualize and analyze process data. Nonetheless, research about statistical modeling of process information using social network methods is still limited. This article explored the application of the latent space model (LSM) for analyzing process data in educational assessment. The adjacent matrix of transitions between actions was created based on the weighted and directed network of action sequences and related auxiliary information. Then, the adjacent matrix was modeled with LSM to identify the lower-dimensional latent positions of actions. Three applications based on the results from LSM were introduced: action clustering, error analysis, and performance measurement. The simulation study showed that LSM can cluster actions from the same problem-solving strategy and measure students’ performance by comparing their action sequences with the optimal strategy. Finally, we analyzed the empirical data from PISA 2012 as a real case scenario to illustrate how to use LSM. © 2022 by the National Council on Measurement in Education.",,,,,,,,,"Bennett R.E., Persky H., Weiss A.R., Jenkins F., Problem solving in technology-rich environments: A report from the NAEP technology-based assessment project, research and development series, NCES 2007–466, (2007);

Firstly, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy value is used to represent the trust relationships between experts in the social network, and a trust q-rung orthopair fuzzy value is defined. Secondly, considering the decreasing and multipath of trust in the process of trust propagation, this study designs a trust propagation mechanism by using its multiplication operation in the q-ROFS environment and proposes a trust q-ROFS aggregation approach. Moreover, based on the trust scores and confidence levels of ex-perts, a new integration operator called q-rung orthopair fuzzy-induced ordered weighted average operator is proposed to fuse experts’ evaluation information. Additionally, considering the impact of consensus interaction on decision-making results, a consensus interaction model based on the q-ROF distance measure and trust relationship is proposed, including consistency measurement, identification of inconsistent expert decision-making opinions and a personalized adjustment mechanism. Finally, the SNGDM method is applied to solve the problem of evaluating online teaching quality. © 2021 by the authors.

The challenging characteristics in political education include lack in knowledge sharing, user's interactive experience, and incentive mechanism has become an essential factor. In this paper, the Deep Learning-Based Innovative Ideological Behavior Education Model (DL-IIBEM) has been proposed to strengthen the mechanism to promote information exchange, enhance the user's interactive experience, and make the platform perform efficiently. Knowledge Network Mechanism Analysis is integrated with DL-IIBEM to strengthen user feedback probability, the average probability of completing social media tasks on a popular network, and the predicted utility degree for individual users. The entire platform is dramatically improved.

Rd., Wufeng Dist., Taichung City, 413310, Taiwan","Effective oral presentation skill is vital for a college student's success in educational, social, and professional life. There is a great deal of research interest focusing on English speaking performance and yet there are relatively few studies suggesting effective teaching approaches how instructors cope with the restrictions in current classroom settings to enhance English as a foreign (EFL) college students' English Speech performance and motivation. The utilization of videotaped peer evaluation is recognized as having significant pedagogic value and has gained much attention in recent years due to the increasing emphasis on learner self-regulation and the rapid development of advanced social networking technology (SNT). Instructors in a number of universities have tried out videotaped peer evaluation in online collaborative team projects to evaluate student contributions to both process and task. This current study was designed to (1) investigate if the EFL college students were competent in evaluating their peers' oral performance alongside their instructor in English Speech class, and (2) to explore EFL college students' perceptions and attitudes towards the incorporation of videotaped peer evaluation and the potential of Social Networking Technology as academic learning tool in English Speech Class. Ninety-two junior English majors enrolled in English Speech courses were recruited to participate in this study. Data was collected via video recording of students' oral presentations, students' videotaped peer feedback, students' English speech evaluations forms. A questionnaire-based survey was also administrated to better understand and measure students' perceptions towards the videotaped peer evaluation and the academic use of Social Networking Technology in English Speech Class. Some statistical analyses were employed. The researcher first compared the means and standard deviations of the instructor and videotaped peer evaluations to determine the levels of agreement between the two sets of marks of the individual speech. Next, independent t-tests were conducted to examine if there were any significant differences between the instructor and videotaped peer evaluation of English speech performance. Then, the Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients were computed to test the relationship between instructor- A nd videotaped peer-evaluation. Finally, descriptive statistical analysis was carried out to analyze EFL college students' view on videotaped peer evaluation and social networking sites as instructional tool for English Speech. The results revealed that the videotaped peer evaluation was similar to the instructor's assessment. Students' competencies in peer evaluation appear to be independent on the oral performance. Students held a positive orientation toward implementing videotaped peer evaluation through social networking technology and agreed on the positive impact of videotaped peer evaluation on the use of appropriate organizational pattern, pronunciation, body languages, confidence, and eye contact. The results provide preliminary evidence that the instructor's evaluation can be supplemented with videotaped peer evaluation and practical implications for the implementation of SNT in EFL English Speech class.  © 2021 ACM.",E-learning Self-regulation; Educational technology; English Speech; Social Networking Technology (SNT); Videotaped Peer Evaluation,E-learning; Economic and social effects; Electronic commerce; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Speech; Statistical methods; Surveys; Technical presentations; Video recording; Collaborative teams; Instructional tool; Organizational pattern; Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient; Research interests; Social networking sites; Social networking technologies; Standard deviation; Students,,,,,,,"Barkley E.F., Cross K.P., Major C.H., Collaborative Learning Techniques: A Handbook for College Faculty, (2005); Brick B., How effective are Web 2.0 language learning sites in facilitating language learning, Compass: Journal of Learning and Teaching, 2, pp. 57-63, (2011); Cheng W., Warren M., Peer and teacher assessment of the oral and written tasks of a group project, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 24, pp. 301-314, (1999); Cohen L.C., Spenciner L.J., Assessment of Children and Youth with Special Needs (3rd Ed.), (2007); Falchikov N., Goldfinch J., Student peer assessment in higher education: A meta-analysis comparing peer and teacher marks, Review of Educational Research, 70, 3, pp. 287-322, (2000); Greenan K., Humphreys P., McIlveen H., Developing transferable personal skills: Part of the graduate toolkit, Education & Training, 39, pp. 71-78, (1997); Holroyd C., Are assessors professional Student assessment and the professionalism of academics, Active Learning in Higher Education, 1, pp. 28-44, (2000); Hsu P.Y., Training college students to use self-monitoring strategies in English speech, Chaoyang Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 6, 1, pp. 1-18, (2008); Johnson D.W., Johnson R.T., Assessing Students in Groups: Promoting Group Responsibility and Individual Accountability, (2004); Johnson C.B., Smith F.I., Assessment of a complex peer evaluation instrument for team learning and group processes, Accounting Education, 2, pp. 21-41, (1997); Kabilan M.K., Ahmad N., Abidin M.J.Z., Facebook: An online environmentfor learning of English in institutions of higher education, Internet and Higher Education, 13, pp. 179-187, (2010); Kwan K.P., Leung R., Tutor versus peer group assessment of student performance in a simulation exercise, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 21, 3, pp. 205-214, (1996); Lisk A.R., Using Teams to Enhance Learning in Management Education, (2000); MacLntyre P.D., Noels K.A., Clement R., Biases in Self-Ratings of Second Language Proficiency: The Role of Language Anxiety, Language Learning, pp. 265-287, (2002); May G.L., The effect of rater training on reducing social style bias in peer evaluation, Business Communication Quarterly, 71, 3, pp. 297-313, (2008); Manasijevi D., Zivkovi D., Arsi S., Milosevic I., Exploring students' purposes of usage and educational usage of Facebook, Computers in Human Behavior, 60, pp. 441-450, (2016); Omelicheva M.Y., Self and peer evaluation in undergraduate education: Structuring conditions that maximize its promises and minimize the perils, Journal of Political Science Education, 1, pp. 191-205, (2005); Pond K., Ul-Haq R., Learning to assess students using peer review, Studies in Educational Evaluation, 23, 4, pp. 331-348, (1997); Saavedra R., Kwun S.K., Peer evaluation in self managing work groups, Journal of Applied Psychology, 78, 3, pp. 450-462, (1993); Topping K., Peer assessment between students in colleges and universities, Review of Educational Research, 6, pp. 249-276, (1998); Yang M., Badger R., Yu Z., A comparative study of peer and teacher feedback in a Chinese EFL writing class, Journal of Second Language Writing, 15, 3, pp. 179-200, (2006); Zimmerman B.J., Attaining Self-Regulation: A Social Cognitive Perspective, Handbook of Self-Regulation, (2000)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"12th International Conference on E-Education, E-Business, E-Management, and E-Learning, IC4E 2021",10 January 2021 through 13 January 2021,"Virtual, Online",169547.0,,978-145038854-2,,,English,ACM Int.

However, knowledge on whether adolescents’ perceptions of the quality of the teacher's instruction are also prone to peer influences is lacking. Method: This study (N = 248 German adolescents) used longitudinal social network analysis to investigate whether (a) friends become more similar in their teaching quality perceptions (influence effects) and/or whether (b) students with initially more similar perceptions of teaching quality were more likely to become friends (selection effects). We also explored whether (c) students with more positive teaching quality perceptions were better integrated socially. Results: We did not find support for influence or selection effects. However, students who rated their teacher's instruction more positively were better integrated socially. Conclusions: Our work adds to research on the role of peers in adolescence and enhances our understanding of peer influences on students’ perceptions of instruction. © 2024",Adolescence; Social network; Student ratings; Teacher support; Teaching quality,Adolescent; Female; Friends; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Peer Group; School Teachers; Social Perception; Students; Teaching; adolescence; adolescent; adult; article; child; controlled study; diagnosis; female; friend; human; knowledge; major clinical study; male; peer pressure; perception; social network; social network analysis; teacher; teaching; therapy; longitudinal study; peer group; perception; psychology; school teacher; student; teaching,,,,,"Robert Bosch Stiftung, RBS; Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs Baden Württemberg; Baden-Württemberg Stiftung, BWS; Hertie foundation; Jacobs Foundation; Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, AvH; European Association of Research; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, (BA 7386/1-1); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/S012486/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC","Funding text 1: This work was supported by a grant from the German research foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, grant number: BA 7386/1\u20131) awarded to Lisa Bardach.

This algorithm factored in school attainment in each subject over the previous three years. Government officials initially stated that the algorithm was used to combat grade inflation. After public outcry, teacher assessment grades used instead. Views concerning who was to blame for this scandal were expressed on the social media website Twitter. While previous work used NLP-based opinion mining computational linguistic tools to analyse this discourse, shortcomings included accuracy issues, difficulties in interpretation and limited conclusions on who authors blamed. Thus, we chose to complement this research by analysing 18,239 tweets relating to the A Level algorithm using Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), underpinned by social actor representation. We examined how blame was attributed to different entities who were presented as social actors or having social agency. Through analysing transitivity in this discourse, we found the algorithm itself, the UK government and Ofqual were all implicated as potentially responsible as social actors through active agency, agency metaphor possession and instances of passive constructions. According to our results, students were found to have limited blame through the same analysis. We discuss how this builds upon existing research where the algorithm is implicated and how such a wide range of constructions obscure blame. Methodologically, we demonstrated that CL and CDA complement existing NLP-based computational linguistic tools in researching the 2020 A Level algorithm; however, there is further scope for how these approaches can be used in an iterative manner.

In the genetic optimization stage, the adaptive variation probability is specifically utilized. When searching the global optimal solution, different variation probabilit ies are used in time according to obtained different fitness values, so as to reduce the population diversity and the number of global individuals. This can enhance the ability of the genetic algorithm to search the global optimal solution. The final evaluation index system is formed by modifying according to the reliability test and the suggestions made. Next, attribute simplification and calculation of index weights are carried out using rough set theory. And the BP neural network model is established wit h the assistance of historical data, which can be served as the main software constitution of an online platform. The attribute reduction by kernel and reduction calculation can greatly reduce the actual computation, which is beneficial for the relevant managers in universities to consider the diverse attributes and make corresponding adjustments for the decision-making scheme. © 2023, University of Agriculture.

This study included 22 high-quality peer-reviewed journal articles for the meta-analysis. The authors reveal that there are no significant differences in teaching effectiveness between the Twitter and non-Twitter-assisted learning approaches. Twitter-assisted learning outcomes are significantly higher than the non-Twitter-assisted whether Twitter is used as a supplementary or an integrated tool. Twitter-assisted learning can lead to significantly higher learning outcomes than non-Twitter-assisted learning in the USA, Greece, and Sweden, but no significant difference is revealed in Spain. Swedish users hold significantly positive attitudes towards the use of Twitter in education, but no significant difference is found in the USA. Twitter-assisted learning can cause significantly more engagement than non-Twitter-assisted in the USA, and male learners have significantly higher learning outcomes than females in both the USA and Spain. © 2022 Authors.

This has led to a rise in the use of altmetrics, which are metrics based on social media data, news pieces, blogs, and more. Here we examine altmetric data linked to nearly 10,000 papers published in 23 conservation journals, exploring five issues that represent some of the challenges associated with using social media data in evaluating conservation. We discuss whether social media activity reflects meaningful engagement, and how easily individuals can manipulate scores by using bots or simply through active personal networks or institutional promotion services. Our analysis shows a highly skewed distribution of altmetric scores where most papers have such low scores that the scores likely convey little meaningful information. Examining scores that would be considered meritorious, we find that papers where the first author was male have higher scores than papers led by a woman, suggesting a gender bias in altmetric scores. Finally, this data set reveals regional differences that correspond with access to different social media platforms. Metrics, like altmetrics, may have a role to play when making rapid evaluations. However, such metrics should only be used after careful deliberation and should not be influenced by institutions looking for shortcuts, by companies looking to advance profits, or by individuals seeking to promote themselves, rather than generating meaningful engagement in scholarship and conservation action. Scholarly and conservation activities should be judged on the quality of their contributions, which will require the input of experts and direct contact with impacted communities. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The research is based on investigation into WeChat groups comprising a sample of 90 university academic and administrative staff. I consider the reasons behind the additional workload of all staff, which is driven by the erosion of the boundaries between the public and private spheres on social media platforms. Participant observation of WeChat groups and interviews with academics and administrators reveal that the emphasis on collaboration on social media and chronic connectivity at work blurs the boundaries between work and private life. Underlying the increased workload and emotional engagement through WeChat groups is a faculty evaluation system that is shaped by market-driven key performance indicators (KPIs) and the centralization of university authority structures. The precarious work conditions that result has increased anxiety about work and private life in the academic community. However, the coercive working environment does not offer academic labourers much opportunity to resist. © The Author 2020",digital labour; social media ethnography; technology creep; university staff; WeChat group,,,,,,,,"Allmer T, Academic labour, digital media and capitalism, Critical Sociology, 45, 3, pp. 1-17, (2017); Andrejevic M, The work of being watched: interactive media and the exploitation, Critical Studies in Media Communication, 19, 2, pp. 230-248, (2002); Andrejevic M, Estranged free labor, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 192-212, (2013); Benkler Y, The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, (2007); Boltanski L, Chiapello E, The New Spirit of Capitalism, (2003); Burawoy M, Manufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labour Process under Monopoly Capitalism, (1979); Burston J, Dyer-Witheford N, Hearn A, Digital labour: workers, authors, citizens, Ephemera: Theory & Politics in Organization, 10, 3-4, pp. 214-221, (2010); Cheung CM, Lee MK, Understanding the sustainability of a virtual community: model development and empirical test, Journal of Information Science, 35, 3, pp. 79-298, (2009); Clough PT, The Digital, labor, and measure beyond biopolitics, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 145-163, (2013); Crain MG, Poster W, Cherry M, Hochschild AR, Invisible Labor: Hidden Work in the Contemporary World, (2016); Crary J, 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep, (2013); Cubitt S, The political economy of cosmopolis, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 58-68, (2013); Fuchs C, Digital Labour and Karl Marx, (2014); Fuchs C, Fisher E, Reconsidering Value and Labour in the Digital Age, (2015); Gregg M, Work’s Intimacy, (2011); Gregg M, Presence bleed: performing professionalism online, Theorizing Cultural Work: Labour, Continuity and Change in the Creative Industries, pp. 122-134, (2013); Hardt M, Negri A, Labour of Dionysus, (1993); Hatton E, Mechanisms of invisibility: rethinking the concept of invisible work, Employment and Society, 31, 2, pp. 336-351, (2017); Hesmondhalgh D, User-generated content, free labour and the cultural industries, Ephemera, 10, 3, pp. 267-284, (2010); Hesmondhalgh D, Baker S, Creative Labour: Media Work in Three Cultural Industries, (2010); Jiang CL, Wang XP, Research on science popularization based on typical WeChat official accounts, Science and Technology Management Research, 40, 2, pp. 252-261, (2020); Jiang JG, Creating consent: casual like, inert consumption and dissolution of community culture, Nanjing Journal of Social Sciences, 31, 2, pp. 126-133, (2019); Khanna N, Johnson C, Passing as black: racial identity work among biracial Americans, Social Psychology Quarterly, 73, 4, pp. 380-397, (2010); Kosnik AD, Fandom as free labour, Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory, pp. 125-143, (2013); Lupton D, Digital Sociology, (2014); Neff G, Venture Labour: Work and Burden of Risk in Innovative Industries, (2012); Nobel DF, Digital diploma mills: the automation of higher education, Information, Communication & Society, 8, 2, pp. 217-233, (1998); O'Reilly T, What is Web 2.0: design patterns and business models for the next generation of software, (2005); Parsell MR, Floyd K, Making friends in cyberspace, Journal of Communication, 1, 1, pp. 80-97, (1996); Poritz J, Rees J, Education is Not an App: The Future of University Teaching in the Internet Age, (2017); Postill J, Pink S, Social media ethnography: the digital researcher in a messy web, Media International Australia, 145, 1, pp. 123-134, (2012); Ramey M, Technology creep vs. productivity - How much does tech creep cost you, (2018); Ross A, No-collar: The Humane Workplace and Its Hidden Costs, (2004); Ruyter A, Brown M, Burgess J, Big work and the fourth industrial revolution: conceptual and regulatory challenges, Journal of International Affairs, 72, 1, pp. 37-50, (2019); Silverstone R, The sociology of mediation and communication, The Sage Handbook of Sociology, pp. 188-207, (2005); Terranova T, Free labour: producing culture for the digital economy, Social Text, 18, 2, pp. 33-57, (2000); Turner F, From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Steward Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism, (2006); Zhou, Wang, The analysis of Christian Fuchs’s critical theory of Marxist digital labour, Journal of Xi’an Jiaotong University (Social Science), 40, 5, pp. 125-133, (2020)",,,International Association of Media Communication Research,,,,,,23571705,,,,English,Polit.

Drawing on three years of social network data in three districts, we find that administrators were more likely to be talking together about teacher evaluation than the Common Core. Further, administrators with more positive views of the potential impact of these policies and their access to the human and technical resources necessary for implementation were more likely to engage in positive information seeking behaviors. These findings have important implications for policies intended to increase instructional coherence in schools and districts. © 2021, Arizona State University.

The teaching effectiveness of physiology courses will directly affect students' learning of other medical disciplines. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current situation and changes in physiology teaching over 30 years in Chinese medical schools. Methods: National survey was conducted online on the platform SoJump via WeChat and the web. The head of the physiology department in medical school was asked to indicate the information of physiology education from three periods: 1991–2000, 2001–2010, and 2011–2020. The responses of 80 leaders of the Department of Physiology from mainland Chinese medical schools were included in the study for analysis. Results: The survey showed that the class hours, both of theory and practice, had been decreased. During the past 20 years, the total number of physiology teachers, the number of physiology teachers who had been educated in medical schools, and the number of technicians had been reduced, whereas teachers with doctor’s degrees had been increased. In addition to traditional didactic teaching, new teaching approaches, including problem-based learning/case-based learning/team-based learning, integrated curriculum and formative evaluation systems, had been employed, mostly for more than 5 years, in some medical schools. Conclusion: The present study has provided historical data regarding the current status of physiology education in China and that in the past thirty years by showing that physiology education in China has developed quickly,even it faces many challenges. © The Author(s) 2024.",Case-based learning; Integrated curriculum; Medical education; Physiology; Problem-based learning,China; Curriculum; Educational Personnel; Educational Status; Humans; Students; article; China; curriculum; education; epidemiology; human; leadership; learning; male; medical education; medical school; physician; physiology; problem based learning; social media; teacher; teaching; China; educational status; student; teacher,,,,,"Teaching Quality Project of Sun Yat-sen University, (500000–12220011)","This study was supported by Teaching Reform Project from Guangdong Provincial \""New Medical Science\"" Construction Guidance Committee (2023) and Teaching Quality Project of Sun Yat-sen University (500000\u201312220011).

Transversal knowledge, skills, and competencies are the foundational elements for developing the “hard” skills and competencies necessary for success in the labor market. In this paper, we introduce an online platform for assessing the attainment of transversal and soft skills. This tool allows us to define levels of competency acquisition and measure students’ development. The use of these competency levels helps improve the understanding of these skills and the evaluation process. The tool also enhances coordination among courses and teachers. The evaluation process can be established on three different levels: self-evaluation, peer evaluation, and teacher assessment.

Materials and methods: The WeChat PBL program was initiated in 2019. The study recruited student participants, on a voluntary basis, who were in their first and second years of standardized training in radiation oncology. We selected classic and trending issues in radiation oncology as the two main teaching topics. Students in the PBL group searched for relevant literature, summarizing PowerPoint presentations or academic speeches on specific issues published on the professional WeChat public platform after an in-depth review by teachers. The final national standardized training examination scores for resident physicians were used to evaluate teaching effectiveness. The graduation scores of the PBL and non-PBL groups were compared, and a stratified analysis was conducted based on the year of participation to assess the teaching effectiveness of this model. Moreover, questionnaires were administered to evaluate students’ experiences. Results: Among the 36 students who joined the study in 2019, 16 (44.0%) voluntarily joined the PBL teaching group. Nine students started teaching PBL in their first year of residency, accounting for 47.4% of that year, and seven started in their second year, accounting for 41.2%. The average graduation scores of the PBL group were superior to those of the non-PBL-focused group for the same grade. The rate of high scores among students in the PBL group (56.3%) was higher than that of students in the non-PBL group (25%). Specifically, first-year residents who joined the PBL group had an average score of 92.3 ± 2.2, significantly higher than their non-PBL counterparts, who scored an average of 88.6 ± 4.6, showing a statistically significant advantage (p = 0.042). All students were satisfied with the PBL WeChat teaching and would recommend the PBL WeChat course to others. Conclusion: The PBL residency teaching model on the WeChat platform improved residency scores and garnered student satisfaction. © The Author(s) 2024.",Medical education; Problem-based learning; Radiation oncology;

This high-stakes task is one of a growing number of requirements to come out of the standards and accountability regime as outlined in the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) document for accreditation for ITE programmes. We delve into the public commentary about the broader commission of preservice and graduate teacher quality in general and the TPA in particular. We draw on Bernstein’s pedagogic identities and deductively apply this theory to explore this phenomenon. We use a data set of publicly available legacy media and social media tweets made over a ten-month period from August 2019 to May 2020 to reveal the focus, inherent bias and pedagogic identities promoted by these public discourses. The paper concludes with discussion about the implications of these drivers on the public perception of quality in ITE and on the status of teaching more broadly. © Crown 2023.",Accreditation; Initial teacher education; Legacy media; Social media; Teacher quality; Teaching performance assessment,,,,,,"Griffith University Arts, Education and Law Group","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

New assessment models built on the proliferation of smartphones, social networks and software developments are opening up new horizons in the field. Method: This study is divided into four sections, each discussing the benefits and limitations of a specific type of technology-based assessment: ambulatory assessment, social networks, gamification and forced-choice testing. Results: The latest developments are clearly relevant in the field of psychological and educational measurement and assessment. Among other benefits, they bring greater ecological validity to the assessment process and eliminate the bias associated with retrospective assessment. Conclusions: Some of these new approaches point to a multidisciplinary scenario with a tradition which has yet to be created. Psychometrics must secure a place in this new world by contributing sound expertise in the measurement of psychological variables. The challenges and debates facing the field of psychology as it incorporates these new approaches are also discussed. © 2023, Colegio Oficial de Psicologos Asturias.
